Description:

What does 'meta' really mean? What can we make of Facebook's change to 'Meta'? Jean-Francois Lyotard wrote about the decline of metanarratives in 1979's 'The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge'. Can we learn anything about Zuckerberg's aspirations from this classic postmodern text?

Lyotard was prescient. He noticed in the 70s that quote ‚Äòthe miniaturization and commercialization of machines is already changing the way in which learning is acquired, classified, made available, and exploited.‚Äô He also that  ‚ÄòKnowledge is and will be produced in order to be sold, it is and will be consumed in order to be valorized in a new production: in both cases, the goal is exchange.‚Äô

            The ancient Stoics based their morals on reason. They created an ethical system that focuses on living in agreement with nature, or, a universal rational principle. Stoic ethics distinguish virtues from vices, seeing a life of virtue as the optimal way to live. From the Stoic point of view, someone who lives a life of vice can be considered a degenerate.

This video explores a couple of examples from Stoic literature on how the ancient Stoics saw degeneracy or, put differently, a bad and sub-par way of life leading to unhappiness.

            Can we survive the coming decades? Given the state of global affairs today, that's probably a question many people are asking themselves right now. The IPCC has just published their answer, at least from a climate point of view. And they pull no punches. We're almost out of time, they say, and we need immediate global geopolitical cooperation to succeed. Oh dear!

The channel is not a debating forum about whether Human Induced Climate Change is a real phenomenon or not. If that's what you're after then I can highly recommend chat forums on Social Media, where people on both sides of the argument go round and round in circles achieving precisely nothing at all.

That is a mug's game. And it's not my game.
