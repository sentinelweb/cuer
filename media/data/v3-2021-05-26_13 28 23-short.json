This video is about how to become unconscious of these unconscious motives that reside in the Shadow.\n\nIn the first part of the video, I talk about motivations in general. And I go into detail about positive and negative motivations and the emotional core of motivation.\n\nThen, I go into Shadow Motivations and how the Shadow works and what the Shadow is like. This includes information about Shadow Aspects and fragmentation.\n\nThen I give a list of steps for how to spot and unwire Shadow Motivations and how to turn them into conscious motivations by finding the core need.\n\n🌙If you're interested in participating in the (1-on-1) 13 Week Shadow Integration Program click the link below...

            "description": "Chaos and Order - How to Leverage Chaos to your Advantage\n\nIn this video I talk about the dichotomy of chaos and order and how to use that knowledge practically in your life. \n\nChaos and order is a reflection of the Yin and Yang principle in Taoism, and are thus intertwined opposites. The Taoist view is to take a holistic perspective on Chaos and Order on both the micro and macro perspective... from psychology to philosophy to politics to the nitty gritty of our individual lives. \n\nIt is often that we are biased toward order and that chaos gets a bad reputation as something undesirable in all circumstances. But we must be able to hold space for both poles of this dichotomy equally in order to respond wisely to the constant change and flux of reality.\n\n🌙If you would like to sign up for LIFE-COACHING or SHADOW WORK TAROT or learn more about my practice, click here... https://www.thediamondnet.org/services\n\n🌙If you would like to support The Diamond Net on Patreon, here is the link... https://www.patreon.com/thediamondnet\n\nFollow me on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook...\n🌙Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/the_diamond...\n🌙Twitter - https://twitter.com/TheDiamondNet1\n🌙Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/thediamondnet/",

              "description": "Eckhart Tolle is a spiritual teacher and author, born in Germany and educated at the Universities of London and Cambridge. At the age of 29 a profound inner transformation radically changed the course of his life. He devoted the next several years to understanding, integrating, and deepening that transformation. With his international bestsellers, The Power of Now and A New Earth—translated into over 52 languages—he has introduced millions to the joy and freedom of living life in the present moment. The New York Times has described him as “the most popular spiritual author in the United States”, and Watkins Review has named him “the most spiritually influential person in the world.”\n\nEckhart’s profound, yet simple teachings have helped countless people around the globe experience a state of vibrantly alive inner peace in their daily lives. His teachings focus on awakening consciousness, which transcends ego and discursive thinking, and can be seen as the next step in human evolution.",

Especially in a time where truth is being manipulated and concealed for personal gain.\n\nDuring such times critical thinking gives a bit of control over truth and the ability to be constantly ready for the things to come.\n\nNever stop cultivating it.\n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:29 Logic and Reason\n5:06 Proper Argumentation\n9:04 A 3-Part Method to Improve Critical Thinking\n11:14 Closing Remarks\n11:52 Datacamp\n\nSubscribe to The Quintessential Mind! ► https://www.youtube.com/thequintessentialmind\n\n▉ Support the Channel ▉\n\nCheck out my ebook ► https://30challenges30days.com\nCheck out my merch ► https://teespring.com/stores/quintessential-mind\n\n▉ Social Media ▉\n\n► Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/adrian.iliopoulos/\n► Twitter: https://twitter.com/theQSLmind\n► Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheQuintessentialMindOfficial\n\n▉ More Episodes ▉\n\nBig Five Personality Traits ► https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvMHMp4ZfPg\nFlow State ► https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttaESqv1SJI10 \nMental Models ► https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bub6C9_9l9E\nExistential Angst ► https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbyBKGA8rJc\n\n▉ Sources ▉\n\nTranscript ► https://thequintessentialmind.com/develop-critical-thinking-skills/\nCritical Thinking Examples ► http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-logic-definition-examples-quiz.html \nArgument Mapping ► http://philosophy.hku.hk/think/arg/complex.php\nGiphy ► https://giphy.com/\nPexels ► https://www.pexels.com/\n\nFTC disclaimer: This video was sponsored by DataCamp.\n\n#criticalthinking #criticalthinkingskills #logic #reason\n\n© 2021 The Quintessential Mind",

              "description": "Eckhart Tolle is a spiritual teacher and author, born in Germany and educated at the Universities of London and Cambridge. At the age of 29 a profound inner transformation radically changed the course of his life. He devoted the next several years to understanding, integrating, and deepening that transformation. With his international bestsellers, The Power of Now and A New Earth—translated into over 52 languages—he has introduced millions to the joy and freedom of living life in the present moment. The New York Times has described him as “the most popular spiritual author in the United States”, and Watkins Review has named him “the most spiritually influential person in the world.”\n\nEckhart’s profound, yet simple teachings have helped countless people around the globe experience a state of vibrantly alive inner peace in their daily lives. His teachings focus on awakening consciousness, which transcends ego and discursive thinking, and can be seen as the next step in human evolution.",
