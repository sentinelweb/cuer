            "description": "This meditation video was developed by a group of meditation teachers who teach meditation in the Plum Village and Insight Meditation traditions. \"How to do Vipassanā Meditation?\"; \"how do you meditate?\"; \"do you have meditation tips for beginners?\" --  people ask. You can use this as an introduction.\n\nYou can gradually increase the time you meditate using the other, longer, videos on this channel. Most experienced lay practitioners find it useful to practice between 45 to 60 minutes a day. \n\nIf the practice of Vipassanā was useful for you, please share it in the comments section below. You can also share any questions there.\n\nHere are a few links for either research or reports on research about the benefits of this practice:\n\nResearch had shown that a daily Vipassanā meditation practice helps with stress, depression, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and many other mind-related issues.

We are a group of meditation teachers who teach Vipassanā Meditation in the Plum Village and Insight Meditation traditions. On the channel we created one guided video that teaches the basics of Vipassanā, and then four silent videos with a repetitive Mindfulness Bell. The mindfulness bell is ceremoniously used in the Plum Village tradition as a central part of the practice. We thought long and hard and designed the channel to repeat itself because Vipassanā must be repetitive to work. A good way to use the channel is to start  from the guided meditation, to learn the basics. Then switch to the silent meditations with the repetitive mindfulness bell, and gradually extend the length of time you meditate using the various lengths of the silent videos.",

              "description": "This channel was created in part to help expose internet users to a straight forward, non-dogmatic approach to Vipassanā Meditation. We are a group of meditation teachers who teach Vipassanā Meditation in the Plum Village and Insight Meditation traditions. On the channel we created one guided video that teaches the basics of Vipassanā, and then four silent videos with a repetitive Mindfulness Bell. The mindfulness bell is ceremoniously used in the Plum Village tradition as a central part of the practice. We thought long and hard and designed the channel to repeat itself because Vipassanā must be repetitive to work. A good way to use the channel is to start  from the guided meditation, to learn the basics. Then switch to the silent meditations with the repetitive mindfulness bell, and gradually extend the length of time you meditate using the various lengths of the silent videos.",

Plum Village is where Thay has realized his dream of building a Beloved Community: creating a healthy, nourishing environment where people can learn the art of living in harmony with one another and with the Earth.\n\nAt all our centers we weave mindfulness into all our daily activities, training ourselves to be mindful throughout the day: while eating, walking, working, or enjoying a cup of tea together. We enjoy periods of silence, sitting meditation, rest, relaxation, mindful work and play.  On this YouTube channel we are sharing Dharma talks, guided meditations, songs and chants from the Plum Village Tradition.",

Instead, what is important is how you relate to monkey mind. This teaching is from the Joy of Living Level 1 Online Program https://bit.ly/3s9gXK9\n\nIn brief, if you are able to avoid empowering the monkey mind as the “boss” on one hand and trying to dominate it on the other, the qualities of the mind—such as pliability and flexibility—will naturally emerge, and the monkey will rest.Subtitles are offered in multiple languages.\n\nMingyur Rinpoche's teaching schedule is available at https://tergar.org/schedule.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about meditation or Mingyur Rinpoche and his teachings, please visit Tergar Meditation Community at https://tergar.org.\r\n\r\nBe sure to visit the Community tab on this YouTube channel for photos, links, announcements, and more at https://www.youtube.com/user/MingyurRinpoche/community.",

With a rare ability to present the ancient wisdom of Tibet in a fresh, engaging manner, Rinpoche's profound teachings and playful sense of humor have endeared him to students around the world. His first book, The Joy of Living: Unlocking the Secret and Science of Happiness, debuted on the New York Times bestseller list and has been translated into over twenty languages.  In early June, 2011, Mingyur Rinpoche walked out of his monastery in Bodhgaya, India and began a ‘wandering retreat’ through the Himalayas and the plains of India that lasted four and a half years. When not attending to the monasteries under his care in India and Nepal, Rinpoche spends time each year traveling and teaching worldwide.\n\nFor more information on Mingyur Rinpoche or meditation, including a free video introduction to meditation course, visit tergar.org.",

              "description": "Vipassana Meditation - as taught by S.N. Goenka in the tradition of Sayagyi U Ba Khin\n\nIt is a simple, practical way to achieve real peace of mind and to lead a happy, useful life. Vipassana means \"to see things as they really are\". It is a logical process of mental purification through self-observation. From time to time, we all experience agitation, frustration and disharmony. Vipassana enables us to experience peace and harmony by purifying the mind of suffering. It leads to the highest spiritual goal of full liberation from all mental defilements.\n\nThese videos are bought to you by Vipassana Research Institute (VRI) a non-profit-making body with the principal aim of conducting scientific research into the Vipassana Meditation Technique.

            "description": "You are all sons and daughters of Buddha because you were given a new life with the words of Buddha. How did those sons and daughters of Buddha live? Samagga—united, free from quarreling, with happiness inside.\nSammodamana —all the time there is compassion, love, happiness, cordiality. That is the quality of a Buddha Putra or a Buddha Putri, of a son or daughter of the Buddha. Avivadamana —they don’t quarrel. If they quarrel then they are not fit sons and fit daughters.\n\nAnd then, khirodakibhuta . Khira means milk, Udaka means water: they live like water and milk joined together; you can’t separate them. And they look at each other with love in their eyes, not with anger, not with red eyes. Their eyes are full of honey— piyacakkhu , so much love. This is their way of life. That ideal must be continued. This is the code of the family: khirodakibhuta . The whole family must live like brothers and sisters. Be an example; be ideal.\nPeople look at you, so it is very important that your relations with each other are very cordial. People should be encouraged, inspired, seeing you. You should attract people towards Dhamma, who, until now, have had no attraction to it. And you must see that those people who have already been attracted to Dhamma are attracted more strongly.\nIt is a very big responsibility. This is the time when the expansion is starting. Now it will be very rapid, there is no doubt. We are very fortunate that we have an opportunity to serve in such a good atmosphere. This is a time when there is so much unhappiness; Dhamma has to arise. It has started arising. It will grow, in spite of us, whether we are there or not. Now we have an opportunity to serve and to develop our own paramis. \nMake use of the opportunity for your own good and for the good of others; for your own liberation and happiness, and for the liberation and happiness of others. May Dhamma grow! May the people of the world come out of their miseries! May there be peace, harmony, and happiness! \nBhavatu sabba maṅgalaṃ —May all beings be happy!\n\nDownload Vipassana Meditation App   \nGoogle App - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vipassanameditation \nApple iOS - https://apps.apple.com/in/app/vipassanameditation-vri/id1491766806 \n\nSubscribe to Vipassana Meditation YouTube Channel Here: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/VipassanaOrg\n\nAnapana Meditation for All: An effective tool to deal with Stress, Fear and Anxiety.\nAnapana Meditation in Hindi - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMfMdj7XAbk\nAnapana Meditation in English - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYJmFdeBfVQ\n\nExclusive dedicated Anapana sessions of around 60min can be arranged on request for government departments, schools, educational institutions, private companies and any other institutions.

Goenka in the tradition of Sayagyi U Ba Khin\n\nIt is a simple, practical way to achieve real peace of mind and to lead a happy, useful life. Vipassana means \"to see things as they really are\". It is a logical process of mental purification through self-observation. From time to time, we all experience agitation, frustration and disharmony. Vipassana enables us to experience peace and harmony by purifying the mind of suffering. It leads to the highest spiritual goal of full liberation from all mental defilements.\n\nThese videos are bought to you by Vipassana Research Institute (VRI) a non-profit-making body with the principal aim of conducting scientific research into the Vipassana Meditation Technique.

One particularly pervasive notion is the idea that consciousness can directly influence quantum systems - and so influence reality. Today we’re going to see where this idea comes from, and whether quantum theory really supports it.\n\nHosted by Matt O'Dowd\nWritten by Matt O'Dowd\nGraphics by Leonardo Scholzer & Adriano Leal\nPost Production: Yago Ballarini, Max Willians, Pedro Osinski\nDirected by: Eric Brown and Andrew Kornhaber\nExecutive Producers: Eric Brown & Andrew Kornhaber\n\nThe behavior of the quantum world is beyond weird. Objects being in multiple places at once, communicating faster than light, or simultaneously experiencing multiple entire timelines ... that then talk to each other. The rules governing the tiny quantum world of atoms and photons seem alien. And yet we have a set of rules that give us incredible power in predicting the behavior of quantum system - rules encapsulated in the mathematics of quantum mechanics. Despite its stunning success, we’re now nearly a century past the foundation of quantum mechanics and physicists are still debating how to interpret its equations and the weirdness they represent.\n\nThanks to our Patreon Supporters\n\nBig Bang Supporters\nAlexander Tamas\nDavid Barnholdt\nDavid Nicklas\nFabrice Eap\nJuan Benet\nJustin Lloyd\nMorgan Hough\n\nQuasar Supporter\nChristina Oegren\nMark Heising\nVinnie Falco\n\nHypernova Supporters\nChuck Zegar\nDanton Spivey\nDonal Botkin\nEdmund Fokschaner\nHank S\nJohn Hofmann\nJohn Pollock\nJohn R.

He is the head abbot of Integral Zen - an expert in both the tradition of Zen and the Integral philosophy of Ken Wilber. \nhttps://integralzen.org/about/teachers/\n\nIn this discussion with David Fuller of Rebel Wisdom, they explore the cultural phenomenon of Jordan Peterson and what his runaway success says about the intense times we are living in - and try to identify the cultural forces moving below the surface, and the necessity to integrate the shadow.\n\nRebel Wisdom is a new media channel making films about the biggest ideas - the spearhead of a new counterculture.\n\nIf you enjoy our films, please consider helping us make more by funding us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/rebelwisdom",

The new is struggling to emerge – and the most transformative ideas always show up first as rebellious. \n\nOur channel trailer was recorded in 2018, but fits perfectly with the crisis we are now experiencing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GGbLez57oM&t=1s\n\nWe created the Rebel Wisdom Digital Campfire and our courses to practice the ideas we talk about - you can read more about them on rebelwisdom.co.uk.\n\n",

One great example of quantum physics’ weirdness can be shown in the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment. Josh Samani walks us through this experiment in quantum entanglement. \n\nLesson by Josh Samani, animation by Dan Pinto.",

            "title": "What is Semiotics?",
            "duration": 245000,
            "description": "This week get a quick introduction to Semiotics by learning the difference between an Icon, Index, and Symbol.\n\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OccamAnswers\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Occams-Answers-1609580059112636/\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/occamsanswers/\n-----------------------------------------\nThis blob is eating dinner. This blob is sleepy. This blob loves you. But how do we know that? This is a job for semiotics, the field of study that explores how humans and other organisms derive meaning from the world around them.\n\nIn semiotics, a sign is anything that represents or indicates something else, called the object. A sign isn’t necessarily pictorial, for example, the feel of a fruit may indicate its ripeness, and the sound of buzzing may mean there is a bee around. Charles Sanders Peirce defined three categories of sign (icon, index, and symbol) based on how the sign is related to the object. An icon directly resembles the object; it shares tangible qualities with the object. For example, a painting of a pipe is an icon representing a pipe, a map of London is an icon representing London, and the sound of coconuts may be an icon representing the sound of horses’ hooves in a film. An index has an implied association with the object; the sign and object are connected in a logical way. For example, a growling stomach indicates hunger, sunglasses and a white cane indicate blindness, and the smell of smoke indicates a nearby fire. A symbol is not inherently connected to the object, instead the connection is a matter of convention within a particular society. Because their meanings must be explicitly taught, symbols are easily misunderstood. Examples of symbols include the dotted lines on a road, symbolizing that drivers may pass one another and the Star of David symbolizing Judaism. Most words are also symbols, as they have no natural connection with the objects they represent.\n\nProfessionals in any field that involves interaction and communication can benefit from understanding semiotics. For example, user interface designers are charged with making websites, programs, and applications easy to navigate, and they often utilize icons, indices, and symbols to achieve that goal. In order to create an effective interface, designers may run side-by-side tests, called A/B testing, to determine which signs are best associated with the intended object. The public’s interpretation of signs changes very quickly in the realm of technology, as evidenced by the highly-debated use of the hamburger button to represent a menu. Through widespread use of the button and careful design choices surrounding it, the hamburger button is now correctly interpreted by most users and has quickly become an industry standard. Similarly, signs may become less attached to their meaning over time, such as the image of a floppy disk representing the save function. Formerly an index, as users associated a physical floppy disk with storing information, this button has become a symbol as new users learn its function without ever having experience with a floppy disk. \n\nAnimators and illustrators also need semiotics to understand how their work will be interpreted by audiences. While some depictions of emotions are based on natural and universal facial expressions, others are symbolic, and only make sense to certain audiences. This became clear when emoji, originally developed for a Japanese phone messaging service, were introduced to the west. This new audience used their own experiences with western comics and cartoons to interpret emoji, often in ways the original designers had not intended. For example, in western animation, an angry character may blow steam from their nose or ears, so western audiences interpret this emoji as angry, while the original intention was to depict a person exhaling in triumph after accomplishing a goal. Understanding how different cultures view certain symbols is of utmost importance in today’s world of global media. \n\nThese examples may imply that semiotics focuses only on human interactions with the man-made world, but in fact, biologists use semiotics to study how all life forms interact with and interpret their environment. The ability to express and interpret signs, however rudimentary, is one of the fundamental qualities that distinguishes living organisms from non-living objects. Furthermore, the ability to interpret abstract, symbolic signs seems to be unique to human beings, and may help to distinguish humans from non-human animals. \n\nWhether you’re a fish looking for food or a student looking for the library, interpreting signs is an essential part of everyday life. Knowing more about how we make meaning from the world around us will help us to be better communicators and creators.",

            "description": "Michel de Montaigne, author of the Essays, On Cannibals, and the Apology for Raymond Sebond, is one of the most important thinkers of the early modern period, the Renaissance, and the enlightenment birth of modernity. I look at his thought, particularly the scepticism he inherited from Prryhonism – Prryho of Ellis and Sextus Empiricus – and how it can be used rhetorically in defense of populists. I adopt Jan Werner-Muller’s definition of populism, especially his anti-pluralism, to argue that Montaigne would have been sceptical of people’s faith in powerful figures and a defender of pluralism that protects against the misuse of power.\n\nThen & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

            "description": "Michel Foucault was a philosophical historian who questioned many of our assumptions about how much better the world is today compared with the past. When he looked at the treatment of the mad, at the medical profession and at sexuality, he didn't see the progress that's routinely assumed.

His goal was to work out nothing less than how power worked and then to change it in the direction of a Marxist-anarchist utopia.

            "description": "Support spreading this book on https://www.patreon.com/peter_x\n\nThe Wade–Giles romanization \"Tao Te Ching\" dates back to early English transliterations in the late 19th century; its influence can be seen in words and phrases that have become well established in English. \"Daodejing\" is the pinyin romanization. \n\nThe Tao Te Ching, Daodejing, Dao De Jing, or Daode jing is a Chinese classic text. The text's true authorship and date of composition or compilation are still debated. The oldest excavated portion dates back to the late 4th century BCE, but modern scholarship dates other parts of the text as having been written, or at least compiled later than the earliest portions of the Zhuangzi. The Tao Te Ching, along with the Zhuangzi, is a fundamental text for both philosophical and religious Taoism, and strongly influenced other schools, such as Legalism, Confucianism, and Chinese Buddhism, which when first introduced into China was largely interpreted through the use of Daoist words and concepts. Many Chinese artists, including poets, painters, calligraphers, and even gardeners, have used the Daodejing as a source of inspiration. Its influence has also spread widely outside East Asia, and it is among the most translated works in world literature. \n\n#audiobook Tao Te Ching or The Book Of The Way by Lao Tzu Translation by S.

            "duration": 672000,
            "description": "Seneca The Younger was a philosopher who held an important position in the Roman Empire, and is one of the major contributors to the ancient & potent philosophy of Stoicism. Seneca exchanged letters with his friend Serenus, on how to free the mind from anxiety and worry in a Stoic way. This dialogue is now called 'De Tranquillitate Animi' which is Latin for 'On The Tranquility Of The Mind'. \n\nSeneca’s words are not only geared towards caring less; they also point out what we should care about in order to achieve tranquility. This video presents you Seneca’s suggestions for calming the mind, so Serenus can become a bit more serene.\n\nPURCHASE MY BOOK (affiliate links):\r\nEbook: https://amzn.to/35e23a5\r\nPaperback: https://amzn.to/2RJYfti\r\n\r\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/einzelgangerstore\r\nMerchandise design by Punksthetic Art:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/JRStoneart\r\n\r\nSupport on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/einzelgangster\n\nMusic used:\n- Geographer - Lightning Bugs\n- Emily A.

The person of amor fati doesn’t seek to erase anything of their past, but rather accepts what has occurred, the good and the bad, the mistaken and the wise, with strength and an all-embracing gratitude that borders on a kind of enthusiastic affection…”\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects on our blog, here: https://goo.gl/cDu7st\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nVisit us in person at our London HQ: https://goo.gl/aRYWCo\n\nWatch more films on CURRICULUM in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/2bVcNyy\n\nYou can submit translations and transcripts on all of our videos here: https://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UC7IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog&tab=2 \nFind out how more here: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6054623?hl=en-GB \n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\nbE9oZg\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/\n \nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n \nMike Booth\nhttps://www.youtube.com/somegreybloke #TheSchoolOfLife",

In the History Manifesto, historians Jo Guldi and David Armitage argue for a return to long term thinking to help us deal creatively with issues like Climate Change and global inequality. The type of history they advocate for is one that draws inspiration from Fernand Braudel’s study of the Mediterranean over the long duree and the Annales School. They also look at how big data is revolutionizing history departments. I also look at stock buybacks and select committees.\n\nThen & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

            "description": "In this video we will be talking about 10 important insights for building your Self Discipline from the writings of Marcus Aurelius. He was also a devout student of the philosophy of Stoicism. During his rule, Aurelius found the time to construct a series of autobiographical writings, now known as the Meditations. In these writings, the Marcus Aurelius offered a number of key insights on how to build self discipline.\n\nSo here are 10 important insights for self discipline from Marcus Aurelius.\n1. Self Discipline starts with finding your purpose\n2. Count on yourself\n3. Show up every day\n4. Practice voluntary hardship\n5. Practice dichotomy of control\n6. Never play the victim\n7. Practice delayed gratification\n8. Ignore naysayers\n9. Find wise people to emulate \n10. Honestly review your day\n\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope you find these insights very insights very helpful to for your self discipline. \n\nEven though Marcus Aurelius wrote it 2,000 years ago — his insights on Stoicism still carry strong weight today. Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in Athens in the early 3rd century BC. Even though it is over 2000 years old, more and more people are discovering how Stoicism is not only relevant to modern times, but can be applied in very simple, yet strong ways. \n\nDo watch our other videos on Stoicism – \n10 Stoic Teachings Of Marcus Aurelius We Desperately Need Today –\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IHyzNHgEQY\n\nMarcus Aurelius – How To Be Happy (Stoicism)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8yVuT4A5Jc\n\nMarcus Aurelius – How To Be Succesful (Stoicism)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mCIfp3rc9M&t\n\nSubscribe To Downtown Success –\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ",

Or did you somewhere along the way derive an impression that you needed to be extraordinary in order to deserve a place on the earth? And, to raise an associated question: are you therefore now relaxed about your status in life?

Nothing quite rivals the prose of his masterpiece Being and Time (1927) in terms of contortions and the sheer number of complex compound German words which the author coined, among them ‘Seinsvergessenheit’ (Forgetfulness of Being), ‘Bodenständigkeit’ (Rootedness-in-soil) and ‘Wesensverfassung’ (Essential Constitution)...”\n\nYou can read more on this and many other topics on our blog TheBookofLife.org: https://goo.gl/Cex2zn \n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nOur website has classes, articles and products to help you think and grow: https://goo.gl/EV0fvo  \n\nMore films on PHILOSOPHY in our playlist below: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLphilosophy  \n\n\nDo you speak a different language to English?

Philosophers Thomas Hobbes, Jurgen Habermas (The Public Sphere), John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Alexis de Toqueville and J.S. Mill among others have all conceptualise the public in a certain way. But what if the public are not who they seem? Polling, the birth of Gallup (I look at its history), statistics and mass consumer society and mass democracy have all changed how the public are thought of.

            "description": "Based loosely on Keith Jenkins’ Rethinking History, this video looks at postmodernism effect on the writing of history, and how ideology, methodology and epistemology shape how history is written. I also look at Margaret Appleby, Lynn Hunt and Margaret Jacob’s Telling the Truth About History, which emphasises how the history of America has changed over time. Thomas Kuhn’s paradigms and Michel Foucault’s epistemes make a guest appearance!\n\nThen & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

            "description": "I look at the social construction of emotions through two famous anthropologist accounts - Jean Briggs's study of the Utku Inuits, Never in Anger; and Catherine Lutz's account of the emotion fago on the Ifaluk Atoll in her book, Unnatural Emotions. Both are paradigmatic of an era of social construction in anthropology that influenced thought across disciplines. Today this continues in the work of Lisa Barrett who in How Emotions Are Made argues for a psychological constructionist account of emotions.\n\nThen & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

            "description": "In this introduction to Pierre Bourdieu, I look at a number of his key concepts: Habitus, Field & Cultural Capital, while focusing primarily on habitus. First I contextualize Bourdieu's sociology in the debates between structuralism, existentialism, and postmodernism. I look at how Bourdieu can help us understand emotions, class and children's health inequalities.\n\nThen & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

            "description": "Affect Theory is a field that arose out of the ‘affective turn’ of the mid-90’s, influenced by thinkers like Spinoza, Bergson and Deleuze. I take a look at some of the foundational ideas, especially through the work of Brian Massumi (Parables of the Virtual) and Eve Sedgwick (Touching Feeling).

In 2008 it won the Canadian Booksellers Association’s Libris Award for Non-Fiction Book of the Year and is longlisted for the inaugural 2009 Warwick Prize for Writing (UK). The six minute companion film, created by Alfonso Cuaron, director of Children of Men, was an Official Selection of the 2007 Venice Biennale and Toronto International Film Festivals and was a viral phenomenon, downloaded over a million times.\n\nHer first book No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies was also an international bestseller, translated into over 28 languages with more than a million copies in print. A collection of her work, Fences and Windows: Dispatches from the Front Lines of the Globalization Debate was published in 2002.\n\nNaomi Klein writes a regular column for The Nation and The Guardian that is syndicated internationally by The New York Times Syndicate. In 2004, her reporting from Iraq for Harper’s Magazine won the James Aronson Award for Social Justice Journalism. Also in 2004, she co-produced The Take with director Avi Lewis, a feature documentary about Argentina’s occupied factories. The film was an Official Selection of the Venice Biennale and won the Best Documentary Jury Prize at the American Film Institute’s Film Festival in Los Angeles.  She is a former Miliband Fellow at the London School of Economics and holds an honorary Doctor of Civil Laws from the University of King’s College, Nova Scotia.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nTRANSCRIPT:\n\nQuestion: Why did you write Shock Doctrine?\n\nNaomi Klein:It came out of reporting that I was doing in Iraq after the invasion the first year of occupation. But I guess it dates back earlier than that. I happen to have been in Argentina making a documentary film when the war in Iraq began. And it was a really amazing time to be in Latin America. This was 2002, 2003. And this was, I guess, the beginning of what we now think of as this pink tide that has swept Latin America. But it was a moment in Latin American history – certainly a moment in Argentinean history – where the economic model that Latin Americans call neo-Liberalism, Americans call the free market. But these policies of privatization; free trade . . . the so-called free trade deregulation in the interest of corporations; deep cuts to social spending; healthcare and education cuts; things like that, in Argentina they actually just call this “el modelo” – the model. Everybody knows what the model is. It’s the so-called Washington Consensus. It’s the policies that have been imposed on Latin America first through military dictatorships, then as conditions attached to loans that were needed during economic crises . . . the so-called “debt crisis” of the 1980s. When I was in Argentina the model was collapsing, and Argentineans overthrew five presidents in three weeks. So it was this moment of incredible tumult and political excitement because people were trying to figure out what would come next. But it went beyond Argentina. In Bolivia they hadn’t yet elected Evo Morales, but they had these huge protests against water privatization. And Bechtel had just been thrown out of Bolivia. And in Brazil they had just elected Lula. And of course Chavez was already in power in Venezuela, but he had successfully overcome a coup attempt. He had been brought back to power. So there were all of these things going on in Latin America that were all connected in this rejection of this economic model. So to be in Latin America when the invasion of Iraq began was a really unique vantage point from which to watch the war. I’m very grateful to have had that experience to have been able to watch that through the eyes of my Latin American friends who saw the war so differently from . . . from the way it was seen, I think, by so many of us in North America. They saw a real connection between their rejection of these economic policies and the fact that the same economic program was being imposed in Iraq through tremendous violence. And you really saw and felt those connections in Latin America. You know Bechtel just thrown out of Bolivia suddenly shows up in Baghdad with the exclusive contract to rebuild their water system. And what it felt like was that . . . was that there was a change going on; that this model that had been imposed coercively...\n\nRead the full transcript at https://bigthink.com/videos/naomi-klein-on-global-neoliberalism",

            "description": "He is considered philosophy's enfant terrible, provokes those on the right and on the left and analyses events from the perspective of Marx and Hegel. Above all, Slavoj Žižek is hip, and has been for decades. The eloquent all-rounder defends his ideology criticism on The Finest Hour - Philosophy.\n\n🔔 Abonniere jetzt SRF Kultur auf YouTube 👉 https://www.youtube.com/srfkultur?sub_confirmation=1 \n\nFor Slavoj Žižek everything is ideology: whether capitalism or tolerance, Islam or simply day-to-day life. Buying a mobile, choosing clothes, toothpaste - it is all cloaked in ideological terms. Therefore for him, Marxist social criticism is not a thing of the past, it is more current than ever.\n\nWhere before people used to be blinded by religion, today they are subjugated by technocracy and capitalism, Žižek finds. Nevertheless, the Slovenian philosopher holds on to the idea of truth and advocates human rights and Eurocentrism. He explains how all this fits together in his conversation with Barbara Bleisch.\n\n\nLiterature on the subject:\n►Slavoj Žižek: Trouble in Paradise: From the End of History to the End of Capitalism. Penguin, 2015\n►Slavoj Žižek: The New Class Struggle - the Real Reasons for Flight and Terror.

Controversially, for Hayek ‘liberty’ did not mean democracy or a commitment to a set of ‘liberal’ ideals. Rather, Hayek believed that liberty was ‘a policy which deliberately adopts competition, markets and prices as its ordering principles’......\"\n\nYou can read more about this an other topics on our blog TheBookofLife.org:  \nhttp://bit.ly/29ov8pg \n\n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/\n\n\nCREDITS\n\nWritten by Chris Grocott\nhttp://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/management/people/chris-grocott \n\nhttps://www.leicester.academia.edu/chrisgrocott\n\n\nProduced in collaboration with Reflective Films\nhttp://www.reflectivefilms.co.uk/ #TheSchoolOfLife",

            "description": "In this analysis, I take a look at our current True Crime wave by looking at the history of true crime and beginning to think about how we might contextualize and understand our own cultural obsessions. I look at true crime in the 16-18th centuries, True Detective magazines in the '20s and '30s, Truman Capote's In Cold Blood, and the TV shows of the nineties, before looking at today. I try to understand the themes and tropes underlying Serial, Making a Murderer, West Cork, the Teacher's Pet, and the Disappearance of Madeleine McCann.\n\nThen & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

            "description": "Jason Reza Jorjani is a philosopher and faculty member at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. He is author of Prometheus and Atlas, World State of Emergency, and Lovers of Sophia.\n\nHere he describes Martin Heidegger's 1927 classic book that served as a forerunner for both existentialism and post-modernism in philosophy. He notes that human existence is radically historical. He also describes three unique approach to human history: antiquarian, critical, and monumental. Heidegger felt that the monumental approach, which looked toward the future while appreciating the contributions of the past, was the most authentic. Jorjani suggests that Zionism is an example of this approach.\n\nMany viewers will know that Jason Reza Jorjani has suffered from libel and persecution as a result of his, generally misunderstood, political views. He is a brilliant scholar who has now been unfairly disgraced and is forced to fight a legal battle, while continuing his research and writing, without any regular employment. Therefore we have set up this \"Go Fund Me\" page in order to assist this worthy individual.

I argue that Jaws is capitalist propaganda in its simplest sense. \n\nZizek argues, through the psychoanalysis of Jacques Lacan, that ideology has the same structure as the mind - ideology maps itself onto the mind to make sense of the world. Jaws - a groundbreaking film in 1975 - might just be one of the best pop culture examples of this working in a subtle way - the ideological mirrors the personal, and the personal mirrors the ideological.\n\nSupport me on Patreon and pledge as little as $1 per video: http://patreon.com/user?u=3517018\n\nFacebook: http://fb.me/thethenandnow\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thethenandnow/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/lewlewwaller\n\nReading List:\n\nSean Homer's Introduction to Lacan is very accessible:\nhttps://goo.gl/Bcy4w3\n\nJodi Dean - Zizek's Politics - is a good introduction to Zizek:\nhttps://goo.gl/idATZV\n\nSlavoj Zizek - The Sublime Object\nhttps://goo.gl/xffKfj\n\nCredits:\n\nImage of Zizek by Andy Miah\n(Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic (CC BY-SA 2.0) - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/) \n\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/25272992@N00/2340905187\n\nEdited by Lewis Waller \n\nMusic:\n\nChris Zabriskie - Divider\n(Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0))",

The Marxist philosopher, Louis Althusser, in an essay titled ‘Contradiction and Overdetermination’ argued that ruptures are overdetermined – it’s the plurality of causes that create a shift, but driven by economic determinism ‘in the last instance.’ Karl Polanyi disputed Marx’s economic determinism, arguing, along with Keynes, that it was ideas that drove history, not economics. I look at determinism in context with identity politics and the linguistic turn and poststructural turn of the mid-twentieth century. Is there anything we can learn?\n\nThen & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

            "description": "In this introduction to Foucault I look at the poststructuralist philosopher’s influences and context (Nietzsche, Levi-Strauss & Sartre, among others), and summarise his position through his three most influential works, The Order of Things, Discipline and Punish, and The History of Sexuality. Foucault’s thought takes two approaches that are loosely related – the archaeological and the genealogical. The most important concept is that power and knowledge are intimately linked.\n\nFor Foucault, different time periods – what he calls epistemes – have different underlying assumptions, codes, and rules, mostly unconscious or at least structural, about how to think about things in the world.\n\nFoucault analyses the way we're discipline by power in the same way. In her introduction to Discipline and Punish, Lisa Downing puts like this: Foucault analyses the ‘means by which the body is made to conform to the utilitarian ends of social regimes thanks to the operations of disciplinary power.’\n\nFinally, the central question outlined in vol. 1 is that of the ‘repressive hypothesis'. The narrative dominant in the 70s argued that where Westerners were once sexually oppressed, we have become slowly more liberated, more liberal. Is it really that simple? Like the rest of his work, Foucault questions this progressive, teleological narrative.\n\nTo conclude I take a quick look at Foucault's thoughts on the multidirectional character of power.\n\nThen & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

What are the economic and philosophic problems with monopolies? I look at price signals, transparency, returns to scale, deep sunk costs, and the infrastructure perspective.

I look at Deleuze's basic concepts - especially difference, repetition and the virtual; his relationship to philosophers like Spinoza and Kant; and how he provides some of the ontological foundations for other 'poststructural' or postmodern theorists like Foucault and Derrida.\n\nI also look at the relationship between the virtual, the Idea and the multiplicity - all important concepts for understanding the rest of Deleuze's work. This introduction should serve to give a fuller understanding of ideas like the Rhizome, the haecceity and 'lines of flight' that are a large part of his later work with Félix Guattari - a Thousand Plateaus. Most importantly, I try to make understanding Deleuze as simple as possible!\n\nThen & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

            "description": "In this introduction to Baudrillard, I look at his thought as it developed from a Marxist framework in Symbolic Exchange and death through to his hyperreal postmodern period exemplified in Simulacra and Simulation. I take an in-depth look at a number of his concepts. \n\nFirst I look at sign-value, which he argued must supplement Marx’s framework of use-value and exchange-value. He then takes this central concept forward arguing that copies of the real – simulacra – became increasingly detached from reality, referencing themselves more than the real and so developing a hyperreality. Postmodernity directs social life through code and simulation. \n\nFinally, I look at the concept of Symbolic Exchange; a basis for revolutionary thought that is meant to emphasize social life, ritual, gift-giving, energy expenditure, and neo-aristocratic values. In doing this, Baudrillard hopes to escape from the ‘law of value’, utilitarian logic, and dialectic history typical in much modern thought.\n\nThen & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

This leads to an array of social and geopolitical concerns regarding the public commons. These problems include but are not limited to ecology, biogenetics, finance, neo-apartheid, crisis management, intellectual property rights, and personal freedom. Žižek touches on all these topics and more in this epic delivery of political and social theory.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nSLAVOJ ŽIŽEK:\n\nSlavoj Žižek is a Slovenian philosopher and cultural critic. He is a professor at the European Graduate School, International Director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities, Birkbeck College, University of London, and a senior researcher at the Institute of Sociology, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. His books include Living in the End Times, First as Tragedy, Then as Farce, In Defense of Lost Causes, four volumes of the Essential Žižek, and Pandemic!: COVID-19 Shakes the World.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nTRANSCRIPT:\n\nSlavoj Zizek: Well people often ask me how can you be so stupid and still proclaim yourself a communist. What do you mean by this? Well, I have always to emphasize that first I am well aware that let’s call it like this – the twentieth century’s over. Which means all not only communists solution but all the big leftist projects of the twentieth century failed. Not only did Stalinist communism although there its failure is much more paradoxical. Most of the countries where communists are still in power like China, Vietnam – their communists in power appear to be the most efficient managers of a very wildly productive capitalism. So okay, that one failed. I think that also and here I in a very respectful way disagree with your – by your I mean American neo-Keynesian leftists, Krugman, Stiglitz and so on. I also think that this Keynesian welfare state model is passé. In the conditions of today’s global economy it no longer works. For the welfare state to work you need a strong nation state which can impose a certain fiscal politics and so on and so on. When you have global market it doesn’t work. And the third point which is most problematic for my friends, the third leftist vision which is deep in the heart of all leftists that I know – this idea of critically rejecting alienated representative democracy and arguing for local grass root democracy where it’s not that you just delegate to the others. Your representatives to act for you, but people immediately engage in locally managing their affairs and so on.\n\nI think this is a nice idea as far as it goes but it’s not the solution. It’s a very limited one. And if I may be really evil here I frankly I wouldn’t like to live in a stupid society where I would have to be all the time engaged in local communitarian politics and so on and so on. My idea is to live in a society where some invisible alienated machinery takes care of things so that I can do whatever I want – watch movies, read and write philosophical books and so on. But so I’m well aware that in all its versions radical left projects of the twentieth century came to an end and for one decade maybe we were all Fukuyamaists for the nineties. By Fukuyamaism I mean the idea that basically we found if not the best formula at least the least bad formula. Liberal democratic capitalism with elements of rebel state and so on and so on. And even the left played this game. You know we were fighting for less racism, women’s right, gay rights, whatever tolerance. But basically we accepted the system. I think and even Fukuyama himself is no longer a Fukuyamaist as I know that if there is a lesson of September 11 if other event is that no we don’t have the answer. That not only is liberal democratic capitalism not the universal model and is just a time of slow historical progress for it to be accepted everywhere. But again try now in Singapore and other examples of very successful economies today demonstrate that this, let’s call it ironically eternal marriage between democracy and capitalism it’s coming to an end.\n\nWhat we are more and more getting today is a capitalism which is brutally efficient but it no longer needs democracy for its functioning. That’s my first point. My second point is that the problems that we are confronting today we can list them in different ways but my point is they are all problems of commons. For example...\n\nRead the full transcript at https://bigthink.com/videos/slavoj-zizek-on-capitalism-and-the-commons",

Newton’s Third Law. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. It’s something we may not consciously clock as we hear news and see devastating photographs of migrants crossing dangerous waters in crowded boats, fleeing for their lives. Why is this happening? If you rewind the history of these countries, tracing political event to event, you’ll find the firestarter – and more often than not, it's a long arm that has reached past its own border to interfere in another country.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSLAVOJ ŽIŽEK:\n\nSlavoj Žižek is a Slovenian philosopher and cultural critic. He is a professor at the European Graduate School, International Director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities, Birkbeck College, University of London, and a senior researcher at the Institute of Sociology, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. His books include Living in the End Times, First as Tragedy, Then as Farce, In Defense of Lost Causes, four volumes of the Essential Žižek, and Event: A Philosophical Journey Through a Concept.\n\n\\r\\nŽižek received his Ph.D. in Philosophy in Ljubljana studying Psychoanalysis. He has been called the \"Elvis of philosophy\" and an \"academic rock star.\" His work calls for a return to the Cartesian subject and the German Ideology, in particular the works of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Immanuel Kant and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. Slavoj Žižek's work draws on the works of Jacques Lacan, moving his theory towards modern political and philosophical issues, finding the potential for liberatory politics within his work. But in all his turns to these thinkers and strands of thought, he hopes to call forth new potentials in thinking and self-reflexivity. He also calls for a return to the spirit of the revolutionary potential of Lenin and Karl Marx.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\nSlavoj Žižek:  We who try to be decent people are bombarded by some kind of moral political pressure from two sides: First there is the worst one, of course, this anti-immigrant populous side like why should we even allow refugees in; it's their fault; third world travel and so on, there are enough poor people here; they come from another civilization; it means conflict and so on and so on. So there is all the time this pressure of we are defending our way of life; refugees are disturbing it. And it's interesting how in some radical right wing circles we really have already new conspiracy theories, which always fascinate me in their madness.\n\n\\r\\nA couple of weeks ago the main Slovenia, I'm a coming from Slovenia, right wing weekly journal something like, Slovene Time Magazine, published a comment by a guy, which was a ferocious attack on George Soros, the humanitarian billionaire, claiming that he's the most disgusting despicable and dangerous person today in the world because he's a Jew who is organizing Muslim invasion into Europe. The guy uses totally open brutal terms like Negroid Islamist hoards are invading Europe. Claiming that the Jewish plan is to destroy Christian Europe and they're using Muslims to do it. Why do I like, I mean don't misunderstand me I'm horrified at it, But why do I \"like\" this fantasy? Because it goes to the end and it brings together two different levels of conspiracy theory. One is Muslim invasion of Europe and the other is anti-Semitism.\n\n\\r\\nUsually we think that there is some kind of a conflict in the Middle East between Palestinians or Muslims and Jews. This theory claims this is an appeared conflict to dilute us. In reality even the Muslim terrorists, all of them, Isis, it's a Zionist creation to ruin Europe. In the good old fashion or Stalinist way you know how fascists spoke about plutocratic Bolshevik plot, you bring the opposites together; they're doing this. So, not to get lost this is one blackmail. But then now things get much more problematic for some liberal leftist. Then there is the other blackmail, the humanitarian blackmail like poor suffering immigrants coming to Europe desperate; is Europe still Europe? Is it using its heart? How can we see all those people suffering and so on and so on? I basically, of course, agreed with this second position. I none the less think there is something terribly wrong in this automatic retranslation of, I don't want to call it a crisis but whatever you call it what's happening with refugees into a pure humanitarian problem, which is ou...\n\nFor the full transcript, check out https://bigthink.com/videos/slavoj-zizek-on-refugees-conservatism-and-cultural-incompatibility",

            "description": "2018 marks the 200th anniversary of the birth of German philosopher and Communist icon Karl Marx. Is Karl Marx still relevant in the 21st century?\n\nPhilosopher, historian and economist Karl Marx is a name that’s back on everyone's lips. The documentary explores the ongoing impact of his writings in Europe and China. How should we approach the legacy of someone who - like few others before or since - not only changed the world, but divided it as well? Even though not everyone accepts his ideas, Marx's analyses and theories motivated many people to take political action. We meet activists, witnesses and experts - individuals who are able to illuminate Karl Marx's impact from the Russian revolution until today. Even in the 21st century, two hundred years after his birth, Marx has lost none of his relevance. After the fall of the Iron Curtain in Europe and the end of the Cold War in 1989 and 1990, the sun seemed to be setting on Marx. But during the financial crisis of 2007-2008, when the contradictions of capitalism were once more laid bare, Marx was resurrected as an icon. His theories and ideas are now enjoying something of a renaissance at universities, churches, and conferences, and in mainstream broadcast and print media. The Chinese have even donated a larger-than-life statue of Marx to the city of his birth, Trier. This thought-provoking documentary does not shy away from controversy. As well providing insight into Karl Marx’s life and work, it investigates what appealed to past and present advocates of his philosophies, bringing the story to life with a rich trove of archive material.\n_______\n\nExciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

            "description": "Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book For All and None was Nietzsche’s favourite of his creations. It is indeed one of the most fascinating and creative pieces of work in western philosophy. \n\nIt presents the journey of Persian prophet Zarathustra, who spends his time in solitude in the mountains for ten years and grows weary of his wisdom, beginning his down-going to humanity to teach them what he has learned. \n\nZarathustra's principal teachings are: the Übermensch (Overman), the Eternal Recurrence and the Will to Power. \n\nThe God is dead theme is most famously expressed in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, although it first appeared in The Gay Science. It is commonly misinterpreted. It refers to a historical event in response to the decline of Christianity with the Enlightenment bringing about scientific rationality, representing a crisis in the existing moral values opening the possibility for nihilism. The death of god theme is prevalent throughout the book.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n⭐ This channel can only keep going with the funding of all of you.

            "description": "An introduction to Thomas Hobbes’ Leviathan. Hobbes looms over all of us as the preeminent defender of the modern state and sovereign authority. Nuanced and original, he is probably the most influential figure in modern political philosophy who, and could be described as the father of both modern liberalism and modern conservatism.\n\nHobbes’ originality was his belief that political theory could be deduced from scientific principles about psychology, the senses, language, morality, knowledge, and power. \n\nTo understand politics, he argued, you had to understand people. Hobbes grounds Leviathan in a state of nature – a theoretical situation in which humans have no institutions, no government, no coercive power – a pre-societal condition.\n\nHuman existence in a state of nature is, according to Hobbes, pretty undesirable. In the most famous passage of Leviathan he says that in a state of nature there are ‘no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.’\n\nIn a state of nature, we have a right to all things, but because we seek our own self-preservation, there are ‘laws of nature.’ Hobbes says that the first law of nature is ‘that every man seek peace, as far as he has hope of obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek and use all helps and advantages of war.’\n\nBecause some ignore or misunderstand the laws of nature we require a sovereign power to keep us in awe; a leviathan.\n\nHobbes has been reinterpreted in the 20th century in game theory terms as a prisoner’s dilemma.\n\nThen & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

            "description": "In a letter to his dear friend Lucilius, Stoic philosopher Seneca wrote: “There are more things, Lucilius, likely to frighten us than there are to crush us; we suffer more often in imagination than in reality.” \n\nChronic worriers tend to be more occupied by the future than by present circumstances. During the day, and even during the night, their thoughts wander in the mysterious realm of what’s yet to come, plotting, planning, and calculating on how to tackle an unfortunate fate that might rear its ugly head.\n\nBut even though they wish to control the future, they’ve never gone beyond the confines of the present. This is because the future doesn’t exist, except in our minds. We can’t live in the future, and we can’t predict it. Sure, we can plan for things that might come, but the present usually unfolds in different and often surprising ways.\n\nStill, many of us fix our attention on the unknown and fantasize endlessly about how things that we can’t possibly predict will present themselves to us. Seneca observed this phenomenon in his friend Lucilius as well as in the people around him. He counterattacked this often tiresome and destructive stance towards the illusory domain of the future with Stoic reasoning, explaining why worrying about it is pointless, and advising us on what to do instead.\n\nThis video (The Future Isn't Real. Still, We're Worried Sick About It) explores Seneca’s antidotes to worry and groundless fears.\n\nSupport the channel:\n✔️ PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/einzelgangerco\n​✔️ Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/einzelgangster\n✔️ Bitcoin: 3HQnEz1LQ4G6dqN2LdZgzc7qoJjJCyWjTC\n(Donated BTC and want in the credits?

            "description": "Has political correctness gone too far? \nWatch the newest video from Big Think: https://bigth.ink/NewVideo\nLearn skills from the world's top minds at Big Think Edge: https://bigth.ink/Edge\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nPolitical correctness is often seen as a debate between two extremes, but there are nuances in the middle of the spectrum. Is there such a thing as being too PC, and if so, where is that line?\n\nWhile philosopher Slavoj Žižek, comedian Lewis Black, and actor Jeff Garlin acknowledge that some topics can be hurtful or even oppressive and should thus be approached with \"good taste and self-restraint,\" they also argue that PC culture has tipped the scales far beyond being balanced. \"If we continue to move in that direction,\" says Black, \"then we're going to be living between uptight and stupid and there'll be no in between.\"\n\nSimultaneously, others—including Paul F. Tompkins, Jim Gaffigan, and Martin Amis—argue that political correctness aims to change things for the better, especially for groups who have been marginalized and discriminated against, and that not being sexist and racist, for example, is not actually a heavy lift. \"The fact of the matter is these people are the people of today and you might be a person of yesterday if you can't adjust and you can't be in tune with what people think is funny anymore,\" says Tompkins.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nTRANSCRIPT:\n\nSLAVOJ ŽIŽEK: I know that there is a lot of sexual harassment, racism, and so on in our lives. And I don't doubt that the majority of people who promote political correctness mean it sincerely. I am not saying that. I am not saying in the way of right-wing paranoia that they are evil people who want to destroy the American way of life. I'm just saying that the way they approach the problem is that instead of resolving it, the predominant effect is just to keep it under check and allowing the true problem—racism, sexism—to survive in a more covered up version and so on and so on. Of course, racist jokes and so on can be extremely oppressive, humiliating, and so on. But the solution, I think, is to create an atmosphere or to practice these jokes in such a way that they really function as that little bit of obscene contact which establishes true proximity between us. And I'm talking from my own past political experience, ex-Yugoslavia. I remember when I was young, when I met with other people from ex-Yugoslav Republic—Serbs, Croat, Bosnians and so on—we were all the time telling dirty jokes about each other, but not so much against the other. We were, in a wonderful way, competing who will be able to tell a nastier joke about ourselves. These were obscene, racist jokes, but their effect was a wonderful sense of shared obscene solidarity. It works. \n\nSo you see this ambiguity, that's my problem with political correctness. You know. It's just a form of self-discipline which doesn't really allow you to overcome racism. It's just oppressed, controlled racism. \n\nI am not an idiot. I am well aware this doesn't mean we should just walk around and humiliate each other. It's a great art how to do it. I'm just saying that's my hypothesis. Without such a tiny exchange of friendly obscenities, you don't have real contact with another. It remains this cold respect and so on, you know. We need this, we need this to establish real contact.\n\nLEWIS BLACK: Political correctness has a tendency to jump the gun before you get to bigotry. Political correctness has no sense of humor so it doesn't know. I will mention guns in my act, and not that this is politically correct, it's the same sort of thing. I'll say guns and then you immediately feel the audience get uptight because I've said nothing but 'guns'. They don't know what I'm going to say, they have no idea, they've got no clue and they jump on it. So what happens in a politically incorrect joke is they hear the first part and they stop listening. So they don't know what the god damn joke is about. I have little or no time for it. And if you have trouble with that, what you do is you laugh. If you think a joke was mean or bad or something that was politically incorrect, you still laugh at the joke then you go 'Ha ha' and later on, you go 'That was bad. I was bad to laugh at that.' Do it on your own time.\n\nI would go to a college campus. The last one I went to was Penn State. They had just gone through the year of Sandusky and Paterno, my opening act had even done Sandusky, jokes about him. And we thought, well, we can't do that because these kids have just been, you know, and when you got on stage you realize these kids are shell shocked because they're not even laughing at what they normally would laugh at. Afterward, when we avoided the topic completely, the...\n\nRead the full transcript at https://bigthink.com/videos/political-correctness-debate",

            "description": "Martin Heidegger is arguably the most important philosopher in the past 150 years or so. Being and Time completely transformed the collective thinking around thought, existence, and our conception of time and it's relation to the human condition. He threw a wrench right in the middle of modern, enlightenment era thinkers, and their practice of ontology. He transformed the backdrop in which we analyze philosophy forever. \n\nThis is the first video in a three part series over Heidegger.\n\nThis entire channel is funded by you all.

            "description": "In The Better Angels of Our Nature, Steven Pinker argues that human violence has declined across history. One part of this argument is that life in a state of nature – before civilization – was solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short. Amongst other things, Pinker argues that hunter-gatherers, tribal societies, were – and are - much more violent than later more civilized societies. Both Pinker and Thomas Hobbes argue that the state and its monopolisation on force and authority have pacified our darker human nature.\n\nThis is a common trope:\n\nIn the 1996 book War Before Civilization, for example, archaeologist Lawrence Keeley argues that prehistoric violent deaths probably ranged from around 7-40% of all deaths. He says: ‘there is nothing inherently peaceful about hunting-gathering or band society’.\n\nIn 2003, Steve LeBlanc and Katherine Register claimed in their book Constant Battles that ‘everyone had warfare in all time periods’\nBiologist Edward Wilson ‘Are human beings innately aggressive?’ Yes. Coalitional warfare is ‘pervasive across cultures worldwide’\n\nJohn Tooby and Leda Cosmides declare that ‘Wherever in the archaeological record there is sufficient evidence to make a judgment, there traces of war are to be found. It is found across all forms of social organization—in bands, chiefdoms, and states.’\n\nThe book Demonic Males argues that ‘\"neither in history nor around the globe today is there evidence of a truly peaceful society’.\n\nPinker has written that ‘Hobbes was right, Rousseau was wrong.’\n\nAre – and were – hunter-gatherers really that violent? Brian Ferguson and Douglas Fry argue no. Looking at chimpanzees, bonobos, Otzi – the iceman – and a range of much more insightful ethnographical and archaeological evidence is the best way to find out.\n\nThen & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

Some scholars extend the term back to Sorin Kierkegaard, and others extend it as far back as Socrates. \n\nIn this video, I’ll explain the difference between the Absurdism of Albert Camus and the Existentialism of John Paul Sartre. Let’s dive in.\n\n#existentialism #absurdism \n\n==== Subscribe for more videos like this on YouTube and turn on the notification bell to get more videos: https://tinyurl.com/thinkingdeeply \n\nBecause the notification bell only sends to a small percentage due to algorithm changes, get notified about new videos and bonus extras here via email: https://tinyurl.com/thinkingdeeplyupdates====",

            "description": "Baudrillard stands as one of the most influential and relevant thinkers of the later 20th century. Best known for his work Simulacra and Simulation, Baudrillard's intellectual career started with The System of Objects. A book that sought to analyze the newly emerging world of sign-value, and the material rupture of early serial commodities. Baudrillard sought to bring a structural, material analysis with newer fields such as semiotics and social psychoanalysis as to give a new lens to 20th-century capitalism. As The System of Objects developed from his Ph.D. thesis, it serves as a relatively quiet, yet important piece of philosophy that helped shape late 20th-century thought.\n\nBuy The System of Objects here: https://amzn.to/39ZKVK8\n\nThis entire channel is funded by you all.

            "description": "Martin Luther King Jr. is one of the largest cultural icons in the United States. Being the face and spearhead of the 1960's Civil Rights movement he is remembered for his racial egalitarianism in the face of Jim Crow and other forms of institutional racism. He is a figure celebrated by nearly every politician, every mainstream political ideology, and is remembered as a character to unity. Yet, many who have extensively read and studied MLK know that this 'character of unity' is a facade of sorts, they know that the American collective memory of MLK is false. These falsities can be explained through an introduction into Baudrillard's Hyperreality, and Jameson's postmodern capitalism.\n\nThis entire channel is funded by you all.

            "description": "Herbert Marcuse and The Frankfurt School of Critical Theory made ginormous impacts throughout the 20th century. As newer forms of repression stemming from the industrial revolution came to fruition, and the reactions to it, Marcuse set out to understand what has happened, and what was happening during the student protests of the 1960's. The Great Refusal was an evolution from prior existentialist and Marxian philosophy, but took focus on changing forms of human subjectivity of power, control and consumption, rather than just the larger systemic structures at play. In the video we go into detail about some major points of the Great Refusal and it's modern day under-examined relevance.\n\nThis entire channel is funded by you all.

Right from the start, Marcuse seeks to refute the Freudian idea that repression is a necessity for a functioning society. Marcuse claims Freud did extremely well at defining the western subject, yet his most important insights are lost with Neo-Freudian and modern psychology. We see that throughout this book, Freud's entire foundation can be viewed from a sociological lens, and that with this lens, we can truly see nature of modern repression, and more importantly, we can find a potential way out.\n\nThis entire channel is funded by you all.

            "description": "This video is 2nd in the 8-part video lecture series, The Self Under Siege: Philosophy in the Twentieth Century (1993).\n\nLecture notes: \n\nI. Heidegger developers a powerful account of meaning by recasting traditional talk of the self and the human into an analysis of \"Dasein\", literally \"being there\". He hopes to discard much of the baggage of the philosophical past in a kind of \"deconstruction\" that has, and continues to be, very influential with thinkers as diverse as Derrida, Macuse, and Sartre.\n\nII. We should not let Heidegger's infamous connect to fascism blind us to his real insights. It is sad, but true, that even very bad people may have important things to teach us.\n\nIII. Heidegger does not begin with a \"method\". He begins by beginning. He offers a hermeneutic of Dasein, or the historical and cultural self. A hermeneutic is a narrative, a story , whose humans are always already interpreting beings and, from this, the analysis of Dasein can begin.\n\nIV. In \"Being and Time\", Heidegger is guided by the distinction between Being and being. The only priority of human being or Dasein is that we are the beings that ask the question concerning the meaning of Being (what does it all mean?). He is no \"humanist\", rather it is Being that draws his concern toward Dasein which he proceeds to analyze across the dimension of time.\n\nV. Humans relate to the past by being \"thrown\" into a world. This means we are socialized and have a language and a view of the self already. Thus, it is impossible to begin without a structure of prejudices as built into our culture and our history.\n\nVI. Humans relate to the present as \"being at home in or not being at home in\". This means that we try to find a satisfying place view of ourselves and out world.\n\nVII. Humans relate to the future as \"being ahead or ourselves\" or \"on the way to\". This means that we formulate projects and make plans. The fundamental structure thus revealed is that humans are beings who care, who have concern. This can be seen in what they build and do even more than in what they say or think.\n\nVIII. Anxiety before death is the fundamental human mood, since death is the end or our projects and our concern. For Heidegger, authentic existence must not \"flee from\" this insight into the unthinking mass of people (the \"they\"), but rather use this insight to give meaning and purpose to our projects. Such projects are \"free for\" and \"free from\" the stifling yoke of conformity to \"the they\" or what other people think.\n\nIX. Against Heidegger's powerful account of being human it can certainly be argued that \"authenticity\" is too abstract as a means to measure our projects. One can be an authentic Nazi, for example, just as well as an authentic Christian. Heidegger gives us absolutely no grounds for choosing one over the other.\n\nX. Authenticity will be important in our account of the self, as will care and concern with a project, but it will not be enough to save the self under siege as the case of Heidegger himself makes clear.\n\nFor more information, see http://www.rickroderick.org",

            "description": "This is a story about medieval Maghribi merchants, Kalahari San Bushmen, American ranchers, Arctic Inuits, Pygmies, The Semai, and Wisconsin businessmen. \n\nAt what price, under the point of whose spear, under what kind of domination, to what justification, would a person give up their capacity to decide for themselves? Or to contribute to the deliberative will of the collective? Who would give up that freedom? \n\nWhat can stateless cultures and societies tell us about sovereign power? Anthropologist Christopher Boehm has summed up his survey of 339 studies and said that ‘nomadic foragers’ have a natural aversion to inequality and ‘are universally – and all but obsessively – concerned with being free from the authority of others.’\n\nAll of the vein pretenses that Hobbes argued would generate violence, in fact, on closer inspection motivate peace. When he said that competition leads to greed, he didn’t give enough weight to the observation that cooperation is more beneficial. When he thought that the desire for reputation would leave to a pursuit of glory he failed to see that reputation selects for kindness, cooperation, and conformity. The sharp tongue of gossip is the most powerful ostraciser. And when he argued that equality of strength would lead to endless war he forgot that equality of condition, of faculties, of the capacity for reason, leads to that most human of values: fairness.\n\nThen & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

            "description": "This is an introduction to the life, work, and legacy of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. There is little doubt that he was a towering figure of the twentieth century; on his return to Cambridge in 1929 Maynard Keynes wrote, “Well, God has arrived. I met him on the 5:15 train”. Wittgenstein is credited with being the greatest philosopher of the modern age, a thinker who left not one but two philosophies for his successors to argue over: The early Wittgenstein said, “the limits of my language mean the limits of my world”; the later Wittgenstein replied, “If God looked into our minds he would not have been able to see there whom we were speaking of”. Language was at the heart of both. Wittgenstein stated that his purpose was to finally free humanity from the pointless and neurotic philosophical questing that plagues us all. As he put it, “To show the fly the way out of the fly bottle”. He was something of a philosopher's philosopher. But how did he think language could solve all the problems of philosophy? How have his ideas influenced contemporary culture? And could his thought ever achieve the release for us that he hoped it would? Melvyn Bragg discusses Wittgenstein and these questions with Ray Monk (Professor of Philosophy at the University of Southampton), Barry Smith (Lecturer in Philosophy at Birkbeck, University of London), and Marie McGinn (Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of York).\n\nMore Wittgenstein: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIK3E9U4Xec\n\nhttp://www.iep.utm.edu/wittgens/\nhttp://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/\n\nThis is a BBC Radio 4 program called \"In Our Time\". \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4",

            "description": "Friedrich Engels, a co-author of some of the most important political and philosophical works in history such as The Communist Manifesto, The German Ideology, etc. has played a monumentally important role in the development of Marxism. In so many ways, Marxism as an analysis can be extremely daunting and confusing to many. Further, the prescriptive political systems that were birthed from Marxism, namely socialism, have been shrouded in confusion. Socialism: Utopian and Scientific seeks to add clarity to Marxism, and the very system of socialism itself. \n\nCome support the channel, make it up on our leaderboard on stream, and come send a message on stream.

            "description": "The Communist Manifesto is one of the most important political manifestoes of all time. One that has stood the test of time, yet in many regards, it's current analysis in the contemporary plane of theory seems more historical rather than 'revolutionary' over a hundred years later. Thus, the question of whether or not The Communist Manifesto can be applied today may be asked. Despite the material formations of industrial capitalism being alive in the global south, the Manifesto is still relevant in many ways in the west.

Or simply put: the harder we try, the less likely we’ll succeed. On the flip side: when we stop trying, we’ll have what we want.\n\nNow, how exactly does this backwards law work in practice?

The slogan of this channel is “in search of”, meaning that it doesn’t support a fixed view or teaching, but instead explores many different (and often contradicting) topics. Dogma and narrow-mindedness are not what we’re about, as we try to stay open to a wide range of ideas.\n\nYou could see Einzelgänger as a portal to many different subjects in the areas of philosophy, religion, and psychology, from analyzing movies to exploring Stoic ethics and Carl Jung to looking at the world through a Taoist lens. Some topics are presented superficially, while others have more depth to them. \n\n*Disclaimer: The material provided by Einzelgänger is designed for educational and entertainment purposes only.

            "description": "Join George and John as they discuss and debate different Philosophical ideas, today they will be looking into the Political Philosophy of Jean-Jaques Rousseau, and focusing on his Social Contract Theory.\n\nA Social Contract is an agreement made between the people and the sovereign as to how society will be ruled, however Rousseau argued that in order to balance people’s freedom with the power of the sovereign it in fact the peoples themselves who should become the sovereign. This social contract theory proposes a direct democratic rule to society. Watch as George and John explain the theory and look at the benefits and challenges of this approach. \n\nThe script to this video is part of the Philosophy Vibe “Political Philosophy” eBook, available on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088QPZYHC\n\nGrab some Philosophy Vibe merchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/philosophy-vibe-store\n\n0:00 - Introduction\n0:25 - Social Contract explained\n1:27 - The State of Nature\n3:02 - Inequality and Amor Propre\n5:03 - People as the sovereign & the General Will\n9:33 - Problems with direct democracy\n12:05 - The Legislator",

            "description": "The 19th century Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard is best known for giving us the concept of a leap of faith. He was a deeply religious thinker, but his ideas have as much relevance for secular lives as Christian ones. He was the grandfather of existentialism, a purveyor of authenticity, and of discovering, amid conflicting beliefs and the demand to conform to the rules of society, who you really are. \n\nAlthough he was born in 1813, his works were not widely read in English until the middle of the twentieth century.\n\nHe published Either/Or, his most famous work in 1843, and in it, through an array of pseudonyms and fictional characters, he discusses competing and contradictory ways one might live life. Should you live for the moment? Seeking pleasure? Or should you live for the interesting? Should you live dutifully? Ethically? Should you conform to the rules? \n\nHe suggests there are three stages of life, three spheres of existence: the aesthetic, the ethical, and the religious. Some of the key concepts are reflective aestheticism, the rotation of crops, subjective truth, passion, and, of course, Christianity.\n\n#philosophy #kierkegaard #philosopher\n\nThen & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

            "description": "This video is 3rd in the 8-part video lecture series, The Self Under Siege: Philosophy in the Twentieth Century (1993).\n\nLecture notes:\n\nI. Sartre is a paradigmatic 20th Century intellectual: philosopher, artist, critic and political activist. For an American audience, however, he is known first and foremost as an existentialist. His novel \"Nausea\" and his philosophical treatise \"Being and Nothingness\" are the best examples of this period in his development.\n\nII. Sartre's existentialism was based, in part, on a misreading of Heidegger as a humanist; but this misreading lead to his own interesting existential humanism. The first principle of his position is an absolute atheism. God does not make us, we make ourselves. Sartre's way of expressing this is that our existence precedes our essence.\n\nIII. Without God, humans are \"condemned\" to be free. Sartre sees our refusal to recognize our radical freedom as \"bad faith\"; a condition in which we treat ourselves as determined objects rather than as free subjects.\n\nIV. Sartre's existential ethic requires us to ask of our actions; would others act as we act? Our decision must be made in the light of our humanity, but also with full autonomy. Sartre recognizes that without God some limits to our freedom remain such as the brute objectivity of nature and the behavior of other people. These limits are seen as negative. In his play \"No Exit\", Sartre goes so far as to say that \"Hell is other people\".\n\nV. Sartre comes to modify and, in part abandon his earlier existentialism in favor of his own development of Marxism. In a sense, he tries to fuse his earlier emphasis on the singular individual and his growing concern with the fused collectivity, the group seeking to change its condition. In \"Search for a Method\" , Sartre uses a discussion of Kierkegaard as a representative of the individual and Hegel as a representative of the collective to express his desire to bring the two interests together in a future philosophy of freedom that, for him, only a revolution can make possible.\n\nVI. Sartre experienced both fascism and the liberation of the 60′s; his philosophy always reflected a profound engagement with his own time. Perhaps he is not a great philosopher, but he is exemplary in his attempt to become a human being in the 20th Century under the most difficult conditions.\n\nVII. Sartre's account of \"bad faith\" and his basic honesty in the face of the human historical condition will serve to guide us in our account of the self and its predicament in the late 20th Century.\n\nFor more information, see http://www.rickroderick.org",

            "description": "From the BBC Radio 4 series about life's big questions - http://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofideas\n\nThe existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre thought that human beings live in anguish. Not because life is terrible. But rather because, we’re ‘condemned to be free’. We're ‘thrown’ into existence, become aware of ourselves, and have to make choices. Even deciding not to choose is a choice. According to Sartre, every choice reveals what we think a human being should be.\n\nNarrated by Stephen Fry. Scripted by Nigel Warburton. \n\nThis project is from the BBC in partnership with The Open University, the animations were created by Cognitive.",

The first part is from the beginning of a documentary on Emmanuel Levinas, then various clips from interviews. The subtitles are my own, take them with a grain of salt.\n\n“The epiphany of the face is ethical.”\n\n\"The face is not of the order of pure and simple perception, of the intentionality which goes toward adequation. Positively, we will say that since the Other looks at me, I am responsible for him, without even having taken on responsibilities in his regard; his responsibilities is incumbent on me. Responsibility in fact is not a simple attribute of subjectivity, as if the latter already existed in itself, before the ethical relationship. Subjectivity is not for itself; it is initially for another.\"\n\nThe documentary (in French) can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmz3bkV7DKA",

            "description": "Fear and Trembling is a book by Søren Kierkegaard written under the pseudonym Johannes de silentio. Through the biblical story of Abraham sacrificing Isaac, Kierkegaard, as a great explorer of human psychology, looks into the anxiety that must have been present in Abraham when God commanded him to offer his son as a human sacrifice. \n\nKierkegaard used the term angst to refer to the dizzying awareness of one’s freedom of choice. It is the anxiety of freedom when considering infinite possibilities and the immense responsibility of being able to choose. This proved to be very influential in Existentialism.\n\nFear and Trembling contains some of Kierkegaard most important concepts such as the knight of infinite resignation, the knight of faith, the leap of faith, the teleological suspension of the ethical and the stages on life’s way (aesthetic, ethical, religious).\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n⭐ Support on your preferred platform (thank you!)\n\n▶ Patreon https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\n▶ YouTube Member https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n▶ Ko-fi https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n📚 The Book\n\nFear and Trembling\n▶ https://amzn.to/3jUGhPx\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n📱 Discord ➔ https://discord.io/eternalised\n🐦 Twitter ➔ https://twitter.com/eternalised1\n📘 Facebook ➔ https://www.facebook.com/eternalised\n📷 Instagram ➔ https://www.instagram.com/eternalised...\n🎧 Podcast ➔ https://anchor.fm/eternalised\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n⌛ Timestamps \n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:00 Part I.

            "description": "This video summarises Nietzsche’s On the Genealogy of Morals in 10 minutes. It is among Nietzsche’s most sustained and cohesive works consisting of three essays: “Good and Evil, Good and Bad”, “Guilt, Bad Conscience and the Like” and “What is the Meaning of Ascetic Ideals?”\n\nIn the first essay, Nietzsche sets up a contrast between what he calls “master” morality and “slave morality” and shows how strength and actions have often been replaced by passivity and nihilism as well as that the revolt of slaves in morals begins in the principle of ressentiment. \n\nThe second essay looks into the origins of guilt and punishment, it shows how the concept of justice was born and how internalisation of this concept led to the development of what people called “the soul”.\n \nIn the third and final essay, Nietzsche dissects the meaning of ascetic ideals.\n\nIt is not Nietzsche’s intention to reject slave and master morality, internalised values out of hand or ascetic ideals; his main concern is to show that culture and morality, rather than being eternal verities, are human made.\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n⭐ Support on your preferred platform (thank you!)\n\n▶ Patreon https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\n▶ YouTube Member https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n▶ Ko-fi https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n📚 Book\n\nOn the Genealogy of Morals\n▶ https://amzn.to/3jj0izq\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n📱 Discord ➔ https://discord.io/eternalised\n🐦 Twitter ➔ https://twitter.com/eternalised1\n📘 Facebook ➔ https://www.facebook.com/eternalised\n📷 Instagram ➔ https://www.instagram.com/eternalised...\n🎧 Podcast ➔ https://anchor.fm/eternalised\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n⌛ Timestamps \n\n0:00 Introduction\n0:56 Preface\n1:18 Essay I. “Good and Evil”, \"Good and Bad”\n3:57 Essay II. “Guilt”, “Bad Conscience”, and the like\n6:56 Essay III.

            "description": "The Myth of Sisyphus is a philosophical essay by Albert Camus and is considered as one of the most popular existentialist works of the 20th century. It gave rise to the philosophy of Absurdism, sharing some concepts with Existentialism and Nihilism.\n\nThe fundamental concern of the book is the notion of the Absurd, which is best described as “the conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life, and the human inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless, and irrational universe.” \n\nCamus draws from the absurd three consequences: revolt (we must not accept any answer or reconciliation in our struggle), freedom (we are absolutely free to think and behave as we choose), and passion (we must pursue a life of rich and diverse experiences).\n\nThe Myth of Sisyphus explores the value of life in a world devoid of religious meaning. His work can be seen as a reply to Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard. \n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n⭐ Support on your preferred platform (thank you!)\n\n▶ Patreon https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\n▶ YouTube Member https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n▶ Ko-fi https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n📚 The Book\n\nThe Myth of Sisyphus\n▶ https://amzn.to/3jQxA9n\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n📱 Discord ➔ https://discord.io/eternalised\n🐦 Twitter ➔ https://twitter.com/eternalised1\n📘 Facebook ➔ https://www.facebook.com/eternalised\n📷 Instagram ➔ https://www.instagram.com/eternalised...\n🎧 Podcast ➔ https://anchor.fm/eternalised\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n⌛ Timestamps \n\n0:00 The Absurd\n2:43 The Problem of Suicide\n5:30 Revolt\n6:52 The Absurdity of Existence & The Myth of Sisyphus\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n🎶 Music used\n\n1.

Though it is a work of fiction, it is often cited as an example of Camus’ philosophy of Absurdism.\n\nThe Stranger has had a profound impact on millions of readers. Through the story of an ordinary man unwittingly drawn into a senseless murder on an Algerian beach, Camus explored what he termed \"the nakedness of man faced with the absurd.\" \n\nThe major themes of the book include: the importance of the physical world, the meaninglessness of human life and the irrationality of the universe.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n⭐ Support on your preferred platform (thank you!)\n\n▶ Patreon https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\n▶ YouTube Member https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n▶ Ko-fi https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n📚 The Book\n\nThe Stranger\n▶ https://amzn.to/2NWoI7F\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n📱 Discord ➔ https://discord.io/eternalised​\n🐦 Twitter ➔ https://twitter.com/eternalised1​\n📘 Facebook ➔ https://www.facebook.com/eternalised​\n📷 Instagram ➔ https://www.instagram.com/eternalised​...\n🎧 Podcast ➔ https://anchor.fm/eternalised​\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n⌛ Timestamps \n\n0:00 Introduction\n0:40 The Story\n5:45 The Importance of the Physical World\n6:12 The Irrationality of the Universe\n8:24 The Meaninglessness of Human Life\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n🎶 Music used\n\n1.

            "description": "Twilight of the Idols or How to Philosophise with a Hammer is one of Nietzsche’s last books, written in 1888. As Nietzsche was starting to become recognised, he felt that he needed a short text that would serve as an introduction to his thought. \n\nIn a letter, he wrote: “This style is my philosophy in a nutshell – radically up to criminal…”\n\nThe book offers a lightning tour of his whole philosophy, preparing the way for The Anti-Christ, a final assault on institutional Christianity, which would be the first part of his Revaluation of All Values. \n\nWhich, unfortunately, he could not complete, due to his mental breakdown in 1889.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n⭐ Support on your preferred platform (thank you!)\n\n▶ Patreon https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\n▶ YouTube Member https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n▶ Ko-fi https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n📚 The Book\n\nTwilight of the Idols or How to Philosophise with a Hammer\n\n▶ https://amzn.to/3tafUtG\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n📱 Discord ➔ https://discord.io/eternalised\n🐦 Twitter ➔ https://twitter.com/eternalised1\n📘 Facebook ➔ https://www.facebook.com/eternalised\n📷 Instagram ➔ https://www.instagram.com/eternalised...\n🎧 Podcast ➔ https://anchor.fm/eternalised\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n⌛ Timestamps \n\n0:00 Introduction\n0:50 Part I.

            "description": "The Meditations by Marcus Aurelius remains one of the great works of spiritual and ethical reflection, as well as one of the key works of Stoicism. \n\nIt is perhaps the only document of its kind ever made, the private thoughts of the world’s most powerful man. Today Marcus Aurelius is considered as the quintessential Stoic. \n\nThe Meditations can be best seen as “spiritual exercises” written as reflections against the stress and confusion of everyday life, a sort of self-help book. He had clearly no expectation that anyone but himself would ever read his Meditations. It seems unlikely that he gave the work a title at all. \n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n⭐ Support on your preferred platform (thank you!)\n\n▶ Patreon https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\n▶ YouTube Member https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n▶ Ko-fi https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n📚 Recommended Books\n\n▶ Meditations \nhttps://amzn.to/35G2Tzk\n\n▶ A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy \nhttps://amzn.to/2RlNFr2\n\n▶ The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living https://amzn.to/35g784r\n\n▶ The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck\nhttps://amzn.to/327S5bm\n\n▶ The Obstacle Is the Way \nhttps://amzn.to/337hXTR\n\n▶ How to Think Like a Roman Emperor\nhttps://amzn.to/3kaTBzS\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n📱 Discord ➔ https://discord.io/eternalised\n🐦 Twitter ➔ https://twitter.com/eternalised1\n📘 Facebook ➔ https://www.facebook.com/eternalised\n📷 Instagram ➔ https://www.instagram.com/eternalised...\n🎧 Podcast ➔ https://anchor.fm/eternalised\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n⌛ Timestamps \n\n0:00 Introduction\n3:35 Stoicism\n4:52 Meditations\n5:48 Perceptions of Good and Bad\n6:15 Constant Change\n6:43 Mortality\n7:28 Living according to Nature\n7:58 Stoicism and Epicureanism\n8:16 Rationality\n8:42 The Power of Our Mind\n9:25 Pain and Weakness\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n🎶 Music used\n\n1.

            "description": "Fyodor Dostoevsky was a Russian novelist and a philosopher. His works explore human psychology in the troubled socio-political atmosphere of 19th century Russia.\n\nHis novels had a great impact on psychology, especially of people who lose their reason, who are nihilistic, or who become insane or commit murder. He is considered as one of the greatest psychological novelists in world literature. \n\nHis 1864 novel Notes from Underground is considered to be one of the first works of existentialist literature. Dostoevsky's greatest novels include: Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, Demons and The Brothers Karamazov.\n\nAlthough Dostoevsky is more popularly known as a novelist, his philosophy greatly influenced Existentialism with his message \"the purpose of life is to act properly by being authentic to yourself\".\n\nWalter Kaufmann refers to Existentialism as \"not a philosophy but a label for several widely different revolts against traditional philosophy\". That is more accurate for Dostoevsky as he never associated himself with being an existentialist.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n⭐ Support on your preferred platform (thank you!)\n\n▶ Patreon https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\n▶ YouTube Member https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n▶ Ko-fi https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n📚 Recommended books\n\n▶ Notes from the Underground \nhttps://amzn.to/2DBRXas\n▶ Crime and Punishment\nhttps://amzn.to/3h2BIks\n▶ The Idiot \nhttps://amzn.to/3bxKFRK\n▶ Demons\nhttps://amzn.to/2FexadH\n▶ The Brothers Karamazov \nhttps://amzn.to/324Kiem\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n📱 Discord ➔ https://discord.io/eternalised\n🐦 Twitter ➔ https://twitter.com/eternalised1\n📘 Facebook ➔ https://www.facebook.com/eternalised\n📷 Instagram ➔ https://www.instagram.com/eternalised_official/\n🎧 Podcast ➔ https://anchor.fm/eternalised\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n⌛ Timestamps \n\n0:00 Introduction\n4:57 Notes from the Underground (1864)\n7:06 Crime and Punishment (1866)\n12:21 Nietzsche and Dostoevsky\n13:20 The Idiot (1869)\n16:38 Demons (1872)\n18:57 The Brothers Karamazov (1880)\n22:17 Why You Should Read Dostoevsky\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n📝 This video wouldn't have been possible without:\n\nThe School of Life\nhttps://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/fyodor-dostoevsky/\nJordan Peterson\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/JordanPetersonVideos\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n🎶 Music used\n\n1.

            "description": "Who are we? How do we find out? What is it to find our authentic selves? What can we learn from the history and philosophy of authenticity?\n\nToday, supposedly, we’re free. Free, to do what makes us happy, to be anything we strive to be, to choose our own paths. We even feel free from parts of ourselves – that our emotions are something separate from us, that there’s a real us beneath them, a supra-inner rational core that transcends everything outside of it, that is somehow higher than fleeting emotions that make us do things that aren’t really us.\n\nThe history of the search for authenticity has sought to understand this true core of human experience. It has been approached in many ways. Sometimes as a revolt against the outer layer, against standards given to us by society. Other times as taking off a mask. Or rejecting reading a script someone else has written for us, whether god or the bible or society and its rules\nPhilosopher Jacob Golomb writes that ‘the concept of authenticity is a protest against the blind, mechanical acceptance of an externally imposed code of values.’ \n\nThe history of authenticity tells us much about the modern world. For Jean-Jacques Rousseau, discovering our authentic self meant removing the masks society encourages us to wear, about confessing why we really say or do certain things. \n\nKierkegaard encouraged us to take passionate leaps of faith, to find subjective truths that were meaningful for us, to take action, to make difficult either/or choices.\n\nNietzsche knew that the death of god meant that humans were free to create their own values, to pursue the will to power creatively, to break free from the chains others imposed on us. We should love our fates - amor fati - but give style to our characters.\n\nHeidegger thought authenticity meant facing our own deaths, as beings-towards-death, overcoming our own anxiety, and stepping away from the 'They' to create something unique and lasting in the world\n\nAnd finally, Jean-Paul Sartre argued that we are, above all us, free to choose who we are, what we do, and what meaning we attach to the world and its objects. We have a piercing, lucid, and powerful consciousness that can explore the world and our own characters, and not using that reflective power, not interogating our own traits, beliefs, and actions meant we'd be living in 'bad faith', inauthentically ignoring our true human potential.\n\nThen & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

Were the actions of mass murderers pre-determined billions of years ago? Do brain processes trump personal responsibility? Can experiments prove that free will is an illusion?\n\nBill Nye, Steven Pinker, Daniel Dennett, Michio Kaku, Robert Sapolsky, and others approach the topic from their unique fields and illustrate how complex and layered the free will debate is.\n\nFrom Newtonian determinism, to brain chemistry, to a Dennett thought experiment, explore the arguments that make up the free will landscape.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n- Well, you ask one of the deepest philosophical questions of physics. The question of free will.\n\n- For billions of years on this planet, there was life, but no free will. Physics hasn't changed, but now we have free will.\n\n- The brains are automatic, but people are free.\n\n- Our ability to choose is often confused.\n\n- Human choices will not be predictable in any simple way.\n\n- In reality, I don't think there's any free will at all.\n\nDANIEL DENNETT: For billions of years on this planet there was life, but no free will. Physics hasn't changed, but now we have free will. The difference is not in physics. It has to do with, ultimately, with biology. Particularly evolutionary biology. What has happened over those billions of years, is that greater and greater competences have been designed and have evolved. And the competence of a dolphin, or of a chimpanzee, the cognitive competence, the sort of mental competence, is hugely superior to the competence of a lobster, or a starfish. But ours dwarfs the competence of a dolphin or a chimpanzee, perhaps to an even greater extent. And there's an entirely naturalistic story to say, to tell about how we came to have that competence, or those competences. And it's that, \"Can do.\" It's that power that we have which is natural, but it's that power which sets us aside from every other species. And the key to it is that we don't just act for reasons. We represent our reasons to ourselves and to others. The business of asking somebody, \"Why did you do that?\" And the person being able to answer, it is the key to responsibility. And in fact, the word, \"responsibility,\" sort of wears its meaning on its sleeve. We are responsible because we can respond to challenges to our reasons. Why? Because we don't just act for reasons, we act for reasons that we consciously represent to ourselves. And this is what gives us the power and the obligation to think ahead, to anticipate, to see the consequences of our action. To be able to evaluate those consequences in the light of what other people tell us. To share our wisdom with each other. No other species can do anything like it. And it's because we can share our wisdom that we have a special responsibility.\n\nThat's what makes us free in a way that no bird is free, for instance. There's a very sharp limit to the depth that we as conscious agents can probe our own activities. This sort of superficial access that we have to what's going on, that's what consciousness is. Now, when I say, who's this, \"we,\" who's got this access? That's itself part of the illusion because there isn't a, sort of, boss part of the brain that's sitting there with this limited access. That itself is part of the illusion. What it is, is a bunch of different subsystems, which have varying access to varying things and that conspire in a sort of competitive way to execute whatever projects it is that they're, in their, sort of, mindless way executing.\n\nSTEVEN PINKER: I don't believe there's such a thing as free will in the sense of a ghost in the machine, a spirit, or soul that somehow reads the TV screen of the senses and pushes buttons and pulls levers of behavior. There's no sense that we can make of that. I think we are...our behavior is the product of physical processes in the brain. On the other hand, when you have a brain that consists of a hundred billion neurons, connected by a hundred trillion synapses, there is a vast amount of complexity. That means that human choices will not be predictable in any simple way from the stimuli that have impinged on it beforehand. We also know that that brain is set up so that there are at least two kinds of behavior. There's what happens when I shine a light in your eye and your iris contracts, or I hit your knee with a hammer and your leg jerks upward. We also know that there's a part of the brain that does things like choose what to have for dinner, whether to order chocolate, or vanilla ice cream. How to move the next chess piece...\n\nRead the full transcript at https://bigthink.com/videos/the-great-free-will-debate",

            "description": "Stoicism for Inner Peace (book): https://einzelganger.co/innerpeace\nThe Kindle version will be available for $0.99 until April 21st!\n\nHermits, regardless of why they’ve chosen their lifestyles, may have closed themselves off from one world; they’ve gained another: a world that’s potentially much deeper and fulfilling. It’s no surprise that hermits have appeared in many cultures in human history. Another example are the Christian desert mothers like Syncletica of Alexandria who abandoned the city and spent the rest of her life in a crypt. Or Hindu philosopher Ramana Maharshi who meditated for many years at a temple, and Rabbi Yosef Yozel Horowitz who spent years of his life in seclusion.\n\nBut even though a stronger connection with God and the prospect of enlightenment are the grounds on which these hermits secluded themselves; there’s also a more mundane reason why spending time alone can be beneficial: it’s an opportunity for self-transformation.\nBeing alone can be a transformative experience if we utilize it correctly; which is backed up by numerous accounts in the field of psychology (see links in the description) as well as philosophy and spiritual teachings like Buddhism.\n\nNow, this video doesn’t recommend becoming a hermit nor socially isolated in ways that are unhealthy and destructive, or gives any ‘advice’ for that matter. Solitude is a tool, which can be used for good and bad, in moderation and excess, and this video explores the benefits that solitude can have.

The new is struggling to emerge – and the most transformative ideas always show up first as rebellious. \n\nOur channel trailer was recorded in 2018, but fits perfectly with the crisis we are now experiencing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GGbLez57oM&t=1s\n\nWe created the Rebel Wisdom Digital Campfire and our courses to practice the ideas we talk about - you can read more about them on rebelwisdom.co.uk.\n\n",

We start by looking at typical conceptions of truth as correspondence or accordance, and then progresssively move to deeper, more foundational conceptions, involving language's capacity to disclose or reveal being and beings.  We also examine various forms of untruth and their possibility, truth's intrinsic connection with freedom, truth as aletheia or un-covering, Dasein (human existence) as ek-stasis, the essential inextricability of truth and untruth, and finally philosophy and the question of truth.\n\nWarning:  may cause headaches, vertigo in the face of nothingness, or existential angst!

            "description": "The pursuit of an authentic self is often compared with the desire for uniqueness, of individuality, of creative freedom. But does this mean, as some have argued, that ‘authenticity’ itself is an individualistic, egotistical, narcissistic, and self-absorbed concept? After all, ‘be yourself', to thine own self be true, and ‘follow your heart’ all conjure up the idea of stepping away from the crowd, not towards it, of living a life for yourself, not for others.\n\nIf we are an authenticity-seeking species, if we crave our own independence, have a desire to be the master of our own choices, need creative freedom, what does this mean for our politics? What does it mean for social life, for businesses and organizations?\nDoes ‘being you’ – rather than pursuing ‘duty’, for example – result in a narrowing of focus just to yourself as an individual? A loss of a broader social vision?\n\nThe philosopher Charles Taylor describes this as a horizon.\nDoes the horizon shrink to focus just on yourself? Do we each have a separate horizon? Are our values relativistic? Or do certain things transcend this horizon? Are certain horizons shared? Does the shared pursuit of timber in the town disappear once the residents go their separate ways?\nHow do we think about societies that still share horizons, that consist of individuals pursuing both their own authentic interests and dutifully respond to the needs of the wider community? \n\nThen & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

            "description": "An introduction to the philosophy and existentialism of Jean-Paul Sartre, looking at his phenomenology, his ideas about consciousness as free, as being for-itself.\n\nAre you free? What does freedom really mean? The broadest definition of freedom is to be able to choose, to make decisions that aren’t forced or determined by someone or something else. But aren’t we all born with, into, and are constrained by personalities, skills, character traits, our specific bodies, emotional make-ups, an IQ, an environment, an upbringing?\nDon’t all of these things make a me, an I, that constrains my possibilities?\n\nEven if we’re free in the world – free to go where we want and do the things we want to do – surely we’re not free from these personal things. Surely we’re determined by them, they impose themselves upon us. Aren’t we imprisoned by ourselves? \n\nSartre’s answer is a resounding NO. We’re always free, unconditionally, transcendentally, universally, and more than that, we can choose to create ourselves, to fashion our experience of the world into a beautiful, meaningful, purposeful pattern; a melody.\n\nThrough his novel Nausea and his magnum opus, Being and Nothingness, Sartre’s ideas about freedom, anxiety, and the transcendence of the ego are all explored.\n\nThen & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

            "description": "In this video we will talk about how to become a free spirit from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. In line with the theory of existentialism, Friedrich Nietzsche preached about the importance of being a free spirit.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche is one of the precursors of existentialism, which emphasized  the idea that the human being is a free and responsible agent, capable of determining his own actions in life through acts of will. He was one of the greatest and most unusual philosophers and in line with the theory of existentialism, he preached about the importance of being a free spirit.   According to Nietzsche, a free spirit is someone who is able to be in charge of his own actions, who is capable of formulating his own worldview, free of prejudices and social norms, who is not dependent on his relationships with other people, and who has the courage to be authentic and fight against the tyranny of popular beliefs. According to Nietzsche, only by becoming a free spirit, would you be able to enjoy this life to the fullest and become who you truly are. So to help you become that true free spirit, here are 8 lessons that you can learn from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche - \n01. Become a master over yourself\n02. Think differently\n03. Learn to live with contradictions\n04. Be an experimenter\n05. Fight against tyranny\n06. Be authentic\n07. Be joyful\n08. Do not get attached to people and things\n\nWe hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope this video helps you in becoming a free spirit.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche was a German philosopher, poet, essayist, and cultural critic. He is considered to be one of the most daring and greatest thinkers of all time. His writings on truth, morality, language, aesthetics, cultural theory, history, nihilism, power, consciousness, and the meaning of existence have exerted an enormous influence on Western philosophy and intellectual history. He was one of the biggest precursors of existentialism, which emphasizes the existence of the individual person as a free and responsible agent, determining their own development through acts of will. By his famous words “God is dead!”, Nietzsche moved the focus of philosophy from metaphysics to the material world and to the individual as a responsible person for his own life. Friedrich Nietzsche wrote several books like The Birth of a Tragedy,  Human, All Too Human, The Dawn, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Beyond Good and Evil, Twilight of the Idols, The Will to Power, The Antichrist, and many more. His teachings have shaped the lives of many people; from psychologists to poets, dancers to social revolutionaries.\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ",

            "description": "This is a tale of three revolutions. Revolutions past – twin revolutions that served as lessons. The second was a counter-revolution, a result of not learning those lessons. And the third, well it begins in 2030, but stirrings of it are already being felt.\n\nI look at the causes of revolutions and state crises in the past, looking specifically at the English Civil War and the French Revolution, to argue as historian Jack Goldstone does, that we're following a dangerous path to potential revolution. The Baby Boomers were the most heavily invested in generation in history but as the population boomed, debt has grown with it. Millennials, on the other hand, are underinvested in, under-housed, and are experiencing wage stagnation.\n\nThis is a tour of generational debt, neoliberal revolution, tax cuts, plague, stagnant incomes, Kings, the guillotine, and more.\n\nThere’s a growing consensus on both sides of the aisle: neoliberalism has failed. And history teaches us that if peaceful social solutions designed to mitigate against excess and injustice aren’t implemented, then more chaotic, violent, and revolutionary solutions will inevitably follow.\n\nThen & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

            "description": "In my opinion, Mark Fisher wrote one of the most important books so far in the 21st century. There is no better way of understanding our economic reality than through this book: how pop-culture is sublimated through capitalism, how capitalism has turned into a psychological entity, how post-Fordism and individual spontaneity are now favorable in the workplace.\n\nIn many ways, Capitalism is us. As work and play are forever intertwined at all times. When we ask the question: is another economic system possible? This is what we are contending with.\n\nThis entire channel is funded by you all.

VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED.\n\nThe Me Too Movement exposed the reality that a massive amount of women, particularly Black women and girls as well as other young women of color from low wealth communities, are survivors of sexual violence. Yet, this reality is not new and has been true throughout much of human history. The solution to this profound problem is complex, but not unsolvable. Finding a solution begins with a philosophical examination of the utilization of sexual violence as a method to control socioeconomic power.\n\nFeel free to follow me:\nBlog: theblackponderer.wordpress.com\nTwitter: @blackponderer",

            "description": "History is more than a record of past events. A history is an account from a perspective. A history is a narrative point of view. And when considering humanity, there exists many points of views, countless different perspectives. So the reality of history is plural. In truth, history is actually histories. How does history manifest its multiperspective nature and what does this multiperspectivity mean? Let us discuss this question with a discourse of the classic Islamic philosophical text, \"The Muqaddimah.\"\n\nFeel free to follow me:\nBlog: theblackponderer.wordpress.com\nTwitter: @blackponderer\n\nBackground Music:\nChillhop: http://youtube.com/chillhopdotcom\nBirocratic - Tony's Belated Breakfast: https://soundcloud.com/birocratic\nBonus Points - Pizza and Video Games: https://soundcloud.com/bonuspoints\nBrock Berrigan - Split Decision: https://soundcloud.com/brockberrigan\nGlobuldub - Foreign Exchange: https://soundcloud.com/globuldub\nGYVUS - This Time: https://soundcloud.com/gyvus\nGYVUS - Tôzen: https://soundcloud.com/gyvus\nJoakim Karud - Canals: https://soundcloud.com/joakimkarud\nJoseph Jacobs - Tune In: https://soundcloud.com/joejacobs\nL'Indécis - Happy Hours: https://soundcloud.com/lindecis\nMo Anando. - Bloom: https://soundcloud.com/moanando",

            "description": "The United States of America is in the midst of an existential crisis. Although the American ideal is one where any citizen can succeed through hard work and merit, apparent social injustice including racial inequality, sexism, and homophobia demonstrate that such an ideal is not the reality for many citizens. Although the United States began as a country of immigrants, xenophobia has dominated American political discourse and policy. Although the U.S. is among the richest and most powerful countries in the world, it is currently the leader in fatalities related to the novel coronavirus pandemic. The number one reason Americans file for bankruptcy is due to medical expenses, as America's systems of healthcare cannot effectively address the wellness needs of its citizenry. How has America's supposed \"greatness\" failed so much of its citizenry? If time is taken to truly understand the history of America, one can uncover that the founding ideals of this country were never designed for the benefit of all, but rather to benefit only a certain \"caste\" through the subordination of everyone else. This truth explains the paradox of American \"greatness.\"\n\nFeel free to follow me:\nBlog: theblackponderer.wordpress.com\nTwitter: @blackponderer\n\nBackground Music:\nChillhop: http://youtube.com/chillhopdotcom\nBirocratic - Tony's Belated Breakfast: https://soundcloud.com/birocratic\nBonus Points - Pizza and Video Games: https://soundcloud.com/bonuspoints\nBrock Berrigan - Split Decision: https://soundcloud.com/brockberrigan\nGlobuldub - Foreign Exchange: https://soundcloud.com/globuldub\nGYVUS - This Time: https://soundcloud.com/gyvus\nGYVUS - Tôzen: https://soundcloud.com/gyvus\nJoakim Karud - Canals: https://soundcloud.com/joakimkarud\nJoseph Jacobs - Tune In: https://soundcloud.com/joejacobs\nL'Indécis - Happy Hours: https://soundcloud.com/lindecis\nMo Anando. - Bloom: https://soundcloud.com/moanando\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nShore by KV https://soundcloud.com/kvmusicprod\nCreative Commons — Attribution 3.0 Unported  — CC BY 3.0 \nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...\nMusic provided by Music for Creators https://youtu.be/5hSmjkencrY",

            "description": "This video is 8th in the 8-part video lecture series, The Self Under Siege: Philosophy in the Twentieth Century (1993).\n\nI. The task of creating a life with the \"self under siege\" to the degree I have argued may seem impossible. At the very least, it calls for what Baudrillard calls \"fatal strategies\". So I begin this lecture with the work of Baudrillard, perhaps the last philosopher?\n\nII. Baudrillard builds on the work Guy Debord, the situationist author of \"The Society of the Spectacle\". Baudrillard traces the symptoms and tendencies of the trajectory of the postmodern; a set of concepts appropriate for a new world of technologies of images and communication developing in the late 20th Century.\n\nIII. The first of these is the Hyperreal. This is the image, the reproduction that is more real than real, reality is whatever can be mechanically and technologically reproduced. This is made possible by the shift from hard to soft technologies.\n\nIV. The second of these is Simulations. Reality is that which can be simulated, xeroxed, virtual reality, images, data flows, information at rapid speed.\n\nV. The third of these is Utopia Realized as the End of Man and World, with all their references to the regulation and control and obvious political meanings. Baudrillard ironically argues that America is Utopia realized in \"the shadow of the silent majorities\" and with all the banality that belongs to all Utopias.\n\nVI. For Baudrillard, we are, or are becoming, fractal selves; split, reproducible, basic life-style changes as fads, the disappearance of experience and the desire for a vanishing reality.\n\nVII. Beyond Baudrillard, Afrocentrism appears as an answer to reconnecting ourselves with \"reality\". But this too is becoming commodified in rap and \"black\" films.\n\nVIII. The Ecstasy of communication, the vertigo of information overload, the banality of a Transparent society; can any of these postmodern symptoms show us the way out of the 20th Century and toward a new construction of the human? Can we find meaning in the \"world\" that is already upon us? It is our task to try.\n\nFor more information, see http://www.rickroderick.org",

            "description": "What can the Holocaust teach us about morality and ethics? Does the Holocaust pose a challenge for moral relativism? Zygmunt Bauman argues yes. \n\nIn Modernity and the Holocaust, Bauman argues that the Holocaust proves that societal rules, norms and standards cannot be the only source of morality. Perpetrators often argued in court that they were only following the law of their country. How can we judge them if morals are the product of a relative social context? \n\nInstead, Bauman argues, the source of morality is in a fundamental responsibility to another in proximity. And there’s plenty of evidence for this. A biological repulsion to killing, for example. Or the distancing and division of labor that was required to scale the genocide. If proximity and responsibility are at the heart of a kind of moral objectivity, what might the consequences of this be?\n\nThen & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

            "description": "In this video we will be talking about 7 Life Lessons From Albert Camus. Albert Camus is one of the most representative figures of the philosophy of the “absurd” or “absurdism,” and his philosophy has inspired a lot of  people in dealing with the absurdity of life. \n\nSo with that in mind, here are 7 important lessons that we can learn from Albert Camus - \n01. Create your own meaning for life\n02. Don’t make happiness a distant goal\n03. Don’t be ignorant\n04. Be a rebel\n05. Spend time with yourself\n06. Be flexible\n07. Choose Love\n\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these 7 Life Lessons From Albert Camus will add value to your life. \n\nAlbert Camus is one of the greatest French writers and thinkers. He was a philosopher, an author and a journalist. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957 and his most famous works are The Stranger, The Plague, The Myth of Sisyphus, The Fall, and The Rebel. Camus is one of the most representative figures of the philosophy of the “absurd” or “absurdism,” which is a philosophical movement having as its central hypothesis that human beings exist in a purposeless, chaotic universe. Camus considered that absolute freedom must be balanced with absolute justice - too much freedom leads to the situation when the strong suppresses the weak but too much justice kills freedom, and we need to live and let live. As a promoter of the philosophy of the “absurd”, Camus believed that life has no meaning, that the universe simply exists and that it is indifferent to people’s lives. We are like Sisyphus from Greek mythology, forever carrying that heavy rock to the top of the hill, although we know the rock will always fall down and our life's work is meaningless. Our condition might be tragic, but Camus considered that this exact condition hides a blessing in disguise: life does not have a meaning, but we are free to attribute it any meaning we want. His philosophy has inspired a lot of  people in dealing with the absurdity of life and even today, his philosophy is extremely relevant.\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ",

            "description": "Suppose we let our life satisfaction depend on things challenging to obtain. In that case, we set ourselves up for stress, discontent, and insecurity. We tend to worry a lot about not having what we want, losing what we have, and the future not playing out as we desire.\n\nA much better alternative would be a minimalist mindset of abundance. If we experience no shortage in getting our needs met, we’ll quickly achieve a state of contentment. And the quickest way to reach abundance is by downgrading our needs. The less you want, the more you have. And when we have plenty, we care less about gain and loss; we’re less stressed about missing out and less fearful of change.\n\nThis video delves into the benefits of being satisfied with little, how this leads to a more carefree life, and how we can experience abundance instead of scarcity through a minimalist mindset. The less you want, the more you have (Minimalist Philosophy for Living in Abundance).\n\nSupport the channel:\n✔️ PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/einzelgangerco\n✔️ Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/einzelgangster\n✔️ Bitcoin: 3HQnEz1LQ4G6dqN2LdZgzc7qoJjJCyWjTC\n(Donated BTC and want in the credits?

But if I don’t let it go now, I will be. \nThe beginning fell into my head several months ago. I assumed it would take a few weeks to make, at most. Little did I know it would sprout multiple heads and take over my life for two and a half months. If you didn’t enjoy watching it, take comfort that I didn’t enjoy making it. (Just jokez. Thanks for watching my stuff as always, and hope you’re well :) )\n\nBonus bonus trivia: The original title was supposed to be \"The Nine Isles of Neverdead\", but google told me Neverdead is already a thing; apparently a video game about demons and stuff. \n\nI'm sorry this one took a while. I'm especially sorry to folks on Patreon. I think I told you it would only be another week about three weeks ago? Apologies, but I didn't want to put the thing out half baked.\n\n A very, very big thank you to a friend who wishes to go by the name Jimmy Cakeshoes. When the editing was almost done, it was impossible to render the video because my PC kept having little meltdowns and locking up. One genius technical fix later from Dr. Cakeshoes and all was well.

            "description": "Through 12 Rules for Life and Beyond Order, I examine Jordan Peterson’s philosophy of responsibility. First, I try to understand what Peterson says about individual responsibility. Second, I take a look at the philosophy of free will and responsibility. I look at determinism, psychology, and history to begin to draw a between what we’re responsible for and what we’re not. Ultimately, I argue that Peterson holds us individually responsible for too much, and that when we look to the history of social movements, we see that social and collective action is just as necessary. \n\nPeterson emphasizes individual responsibility to an unreasonable degree, while discounting the necessity and power of social or collective responsibility.\n\nWe also take a few detours down some familiar routes: feminism, postmodern neo-Marxism, and identity politics.\n\n#jordanpeterson #critique #identitypolitics #responsibility\n\nThen & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

His (and Guatarri's) ideas on deterritorialization, multiplicities, the rhizome, speed, and others create new philosophical narratives that pierce the veil of metaphysics. Something deemed half-way obsolete by many in the 20th century. Here we explore his metaphysical relationship with arguably his largest influence. That being Spinoza.\n\nThis entire channel is funded by you all. If this channel is something you enjoy, supporting keeps it alive.

            "description": "Jordan Peterson is famously critical of ideology. He has a particular distain for Marxism, Stalinism, Nazism, Postmodernism, Feminism, in fact, any ism. Instead, he argues, that the individual is sovereign, ideology should be renounced, and that, quote, ‘If we each live properly, we will collectively flourish.’\n\nRule VI of Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life is 'Abandon Ideology'.\n\nDrawing on the Russian novelist Dostoevsky, Peterson interprets ideology as ‘rigid, comprehensive, utopian’ and predicated on a few ‘apparently self-evident axioms’. An ism theorist, he argues, ‘generates a small number of explanatory principles of forces’ that can supposedly ‘explain everything: all the past, all the present, and all the future.’ An ideologue, he continues, ‘grants these small number of forces primary causal power, while ignoring others of equal or greater importance.’\n\nThe result of this is that ‘an ideologue can consider him or herself in possession of the complete truth.’ I take a look at what philosophers say ideology is, what Jordan Peterson’s ideology – a type of Juedo-Christian Mythic Conservatism – look at its limits, and finally, ask why we need ideology.\n\n#jordanpeterson #peterson #ideology #politics #philosophy\n\nThen & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

But focusing on them too much to the point that we spend hours and hours dwelling on what people might think can leave us in agony. It’s not only potentially harmful but also unnecessary. This video explains why based on several concepts from psychology and philosophy.

            "description": "The Phenomenology philosophy is a school of philosophy that originated in the 20th century. With Edmund Husserl Phenomenology was born but it was the phenomenology Heidegger innovated that reoriented the course of European philosophy. \nThe Phenomenology of Husserl and Heidegger (whose respective philosophies are called Transcendental Phenomenology and Existential Phenomenology) does not seek after external objective truth—as philosophy and science generally do—phenomenology strives for subjective truth—in Husserl’s case it is an attempt to make a subjective science of consciousness. Husserl developed a method for attaining this truth which involves reducing away the noise so as to isolate the essence of a phenomenon. Heidegger parted from Husserl saying that phenomenology could not be a science with knowledge because the meaning of a phenomenon is context-dependent. Heidegger moves from Husserl’s epistemological project to an ontological program. \nThere is a growing scholarship looking at the connection between phenomenology and eastern philosophy. It is even said that Heidgger was influenced in his conception of Dasein as being-in-the-world through a German commentator on Taoist philosopher Chuang-tzu.\n \n_________________\n⭐ Support the channel (thank you!)\n▶ Patreon: patreon.com/thelivingphilosophy\n▶ Ko-fi: ko-fi.com/thelivingphilosophy \n\n_________________\n📚 Sources:\nHeidegger, M., 2010.

            "description": "Why There Are No Viable Political Alternatives to Unbridled Capitalism\nWatch the newest video from Big Think: https://bigth.ink/NewVideo\nJoin Big Think Edge for exclusive videos: https://bigth.ink/Edge\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n\"Behind every rise of fascism is a failed revolution,\" said the Frankfurt School thinker Walter Benjamin. Here, Slavoj Žižek revives that statement in the context of so-called Islamic fascism, or Islamic fundamentalism. What can explain the rise of groups like ISIS? The secular Islamic left, which grew in popularity through the 1950s and 60s, has weakened, if not failed, leaving no program effective enough to mobilize the millions of people needed for a popular movement.\n\nWhy has the left failed? According to Žižek, it failed to appreciate the end of the 20th century. Not only has Stalinist communism failed — today in China, the main function of the communist party is capitalist in nature, i.e. to prevent the rise of a workers' rights party — but social democracy has also failed. The welfare state of western Europe is no longer liberal, i.e. new and progressive, but a conservative force that tries to hold onto rights that were gained decades ago. According to Žižek, life is moving too fast — through digital, scientific, and economic changes — for old rights to apply.\nFinally, local democracy is no longer an applicable model of society on which the left can build a political platform. Unlike Yanis Varoufakis, Greece's former finance minister, who believes simple democratic reorganization of power represents a path forward for Europe, Žižek points to the immigrant crisis in Europe. Angela Merkel has defied the will of the German people to accept Syrian immigrants into her state. She has acted anti-democratically, and yet liberally.\n\nWhat is ultimately needed is a new conception of the left — a new kind of progressive platform — that does not rely on old tropes. We must either rely on that, says Žižek, or prepare for the Hunger Games-inspired society which Hollywood has warned us is coming down the pike.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nSLAVOJ ŽIŽEK:\n\nSlavoj Žižek is a Slovenian philosopher and cultural critic. He is a professor at the European Graduate School, International Director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities, Birkbeck College, University of London, and a senior researcher at the Institute of Sociology, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. His books include Living in the End Times, First as Tragedy, Then as Farce, In Defense of Lost Causes, four volumes of the Essential Žižek, and Pandemic!: COVID-19 Shakes the World.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nTRANSCRIPT:\n\nSlavoj Žižek:  I still believe in the saying of this oath Frankford School fellow traveler Marxist Valter Benjamin who said that behind every rise of fascism there is a failed revolution. I think even if we strategically, I'm not sure about it, accept this term Islam fascism for Islamic fundamentalist, this so called Islam fundamentalism is strictly relative with the disintegration of secular Islamic left, which was pretty strong in the '50s, '60s and so on, but then began to disintegrate. So I think we shouldn't be too fascinated with this phenomenon. We should rather ask what happened with the left. I think this phenomenon of right wing populism are strictly the obverse of something that did not happen. They didn't just happen, they happened because something else didn't happen because the left didn't provide a proper answer. And that's for me the true tragedy today. On the one hand we are entering a period, and we are already in this period for almost ten years, where rage, discontent are exploding everywhere, even in our Western countries, Occupy Wall Street in Europe, the demonstrations in France, Greece and so on. On the other hand it is as if the left, even if it succeeds in, sometimes not always, in recapturing the energy of this rage cannot really offer a new political model that would be not only seductive enough to mobilize millions of people, but even in itself it doesn't have enough consistency. What I'm saying is this, in Europe we didn't yet fully accept the fact that the 20th century is over. By this I mean the following: The 20th century left, which had basically three strengths orientations, Stalinist communism, that's over. Not only it's over, in a beautiful irony where ex-communists are still in power they are mostly the most efficient agents of the most ruthless new liberal global capitalism...\n\nRead the full transcript at https://bigthink.com/videos/slavoj-zizek-on-the-failures-of-the-leftist-movement",

The talking heads from the realms of religion, science, politics, and the media all claim to possess knowledge.  In this gladiatorial arena of argumentation too often the victor is the loudest voice, not the strongest argument.  The mob chooses the views that live and die on the basis of their heart, their fears, or their pain.  Rarely do they include their head.  Having grown weary of this lifestyle of panem et circenses, I long to journey back across the Mediterranean to a land of logos and arete.

            "description": "Slavoj Žižek is the modern incarnation of an absolute ton of prior theory. Just mixed with some weird mad scientist aesthetic. He is widely known by many, but, is often either misunderstood or people just don't really know much of his theoretical backdrop. His work includes everything from Hegel, Marx, Althusser, Lacan, Kant, etc. And undeniably, Žižek's magnum opus and baseline for all future work is The Sublime Object of Ideology. This book is so densely packed with theory, that it often needs some external context and further explanation. This is what I have hoped to achieve for some.\n\nThe Sublime Object of Ideology concerns itself with the question surrounding ideology, our interactions in the context of psychoanalysis and the like. The book is at the heart and core of Žižek. Thus, undeniably deserves our attention.\n\nCheck out PlasticPills:\nLacan, the Mirror Stage: https://youtu.be/50k_IUMrehU\nLacan, the Real: https://youtu.be/1UPhrQjHi_s\nAlthusser on Capitalist Ideology and State Apparatuses: https://youtu.be/r6w5gPtChhU\n\nThis entire channel is funded by you all.

            "duration": 917000,
            "description": "What keeps a human being going? The purest answer to this question is perhaps to be found in the worst of places. Austrian psychiatrist, philosopher, and author Viktor Frankl spent three years in four different concentration camps. He was at the mercy of sadistic SS guards and the so-called “Capos:” prisoners with special privileges who willingly collaborated with the Nazis and were even more ruthless than their masters. \n\nThe camp inmates were constantly exposed to famine, sickness, slave labor, and the possibility of punishment or execution. There was no freedom. The prisoners moved around like a defenseless flock of sheep, kicked and beaten by their shepherds, stripped of all human dignity.\n\nWhat’s left to live for in such a horrible place like a concentration camp? When they’ve taken all your liberties and possessions, and when death at short notice is almost inevitable, is there any reason not to give up on life? Viktor Frankl concluded that there’s always a reason to live even in the worst conditions: there’s always meaning in suffering. And if we can grasp this meaning - this star in the sky - we can overcome even the most painful circumstances. \n\nAccording to Viktor Frankl, it’s not pleasure nor success and power that essentially drives people; it’s finding something - a purpose, a meaning - to live and even die for (Finding Something to Live and Die For | The Philosophy of Viktor Frankl).\n\nThe quotes in this video are from Viktor Frankl's book 'Man's Search for Meaning'.\n\nSupport the channel:\n✔️ PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/einzelgangerco\n✔️ Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/einzelgangster\n✔️ Bitcoin: 3HQnEz1LQ4G6dqN2LdZgzc7qoJjJCyWjTC\n(Donated BTC and want in the credits?

The shadow is the conglomeration of all of our disowned traits, that function autonomously within our personality and manifest as various issues and neuroses. In order to heal ourselves, we must learn to reintegrate the traits that we have relegated to the shadow so that we can become whole again.

We’re not getting any younger. There are a lot of other people – especially at work and in the invisible parts of their life – who would have great things to offer them.
